Please enable removing language code from the Dev Center language history For example if you ever selected ru and ru-ru languages and you published this xap to the Store then it causes Tile localization to show the en-us(default) tile localization which is bad.,1
Some of my users will still receive the old xap version of my app.,0
The store randomly gives the old xap or the new xap version of my app.,0
My app has a WP7 version and a WP8 version XAP in the same submission.,0
The wp7 xap works only on WP7 and the wp8 xap works only for WP8.,0
Sometimes the Store gives the wrong wp7 xap version of my app to Windows Phone 8 users.,0

"Currently if you ever mistakenly selected a ru language than you will be in a very bad situation forever: - You can live with the wrong Tile displayed for Russian language in the Store (the english one) or - You can publish an update with the removed ru language, but this update will not fully replace the old version and you will in truble: 1.)",0

I recently had to use this API for a private client certificate.,0
And I was surprised to read in the MSDN that it returns nothing as a result of its async call.,0
I would really have thought it returns the just imported pfx.,0

To quote from Windows Phone web site https:/dev.windowsphone.com/en-US/OEM/docs/Welcome/WindowsPhone8.1 Windows Phone 8.1 introduces the ability to write certain drivers as user-mode drivers by using UMDF 2.0.,0
"With UMDF 2.0, you can write UMDF drivers that use C-style syntax and call many of the same methods that are available to KMDF drivers. But this is limited to phone makers OEMs.",0
"However since phones are becoming more and more like PCs used to be and hardware extensions are starting to appear, like the Structure Sensor which is designed to work with IPhone and Android.",0
"Since UMDF USB drivers are absolutely safe from harming the system thus guarding from penetrating the SP networks, it would be a good idea to allow 3rd party registered device driver developers to be able to develop UMDF signed drivers, submitted for testing and approval for such devices as I mentioned before.",1

Apple provides a similar capability via iTunes Connect (https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/LanguagesUtilities/Conceptual/iTunesConnectGuide/8AddingNewApps/AddingNewApps.html).,0
"This capability would not only enhance the submission experience, but it would also allow for Store submissions to be added and tracked in the developers source control system (e.g., TFS, git).",0
"Optionally, it would also be great for this capability to support selection of markets and price points that the app is intended to target.",1
"As a starting point, it would be fine for the developer to download from the Dev Center a starter template that is a ZIP file with basic XML templates and placeholder filenames, which the developer could then tweak/modify for the app she wants to submit.",0

Currently its very hard to debug Hybrid and Webapps.,0
"When you create a webview you simply cannot see the DOM or any normal information to see whats going on, what goes wrong and why it goes wrong.",0

And voor Android devices you open Chrome and go to about:devices.,0

Quite unfortunate.,0
Reasons to transfer an app: - Transfer ownership to a different person or group + Ex: An app is purchased by a different company.,0

Currently windows phone is very restricted for developers.,0

"The new Geolocator API and implementation is so unreliable, that it cant be used with any confidence in a product.",0
Problems I have encountered: 1) While using PositionChanged event Geolocator.ReportInterval seems to be ignored.,0
"The simulator does a reasonable job of honouring the reporting interval, phones seem to ignore it completely e.g.",0
"ReportInterval set to 1 second, the phone would regularly take 30 - 45 seconds and sometimes minutes to report.",0
As a developer I expect the ReportInterval to be honoured with a high degree of accuracy.,0
"If the Phone doesnt have an accurate location, simply return what it does have.",0
"2) GetPositionAsync() and GetGeopositionAsync(TimeSpan, TimeSpan) regularly never return.",0
"Because the event based location reporting is unreliable I have tried to use these APIs instead, unfortunately they are also unreliable.",0
The GetGeopositionAsync method will work maybe 15 times in a row and then simply stop working and never return... despite having a timeout parameter!??,0
3) In general the API is poorly designed.,0
Changing properties on an active Gelocator causes exceptions.,0
Getting the Geolocator to actually do something requires getting the magical (and undocumented) setting of properties correct and then attaching event handlers i.e.,0
the API is too implicit it works on side-effect rather than deliberate commands.,0

So what I suggest is give flexible background service for development and notify user while installing the app about the background services that will be running and battery consumption it might cause.And then user can decide to install the app or not.,1

Have you ever decided not to download an app while browsing the store simply because it did not have any ratings or reviews?,0
If so then this issue should concern you as a developer.,0
The app store currently only shows consumers app ratings and reviews in the country that you live in.,0
So for example if an app is published in Canada and the United States and only the users in Canada leave a rating/reviews then the users in the United States will not see those ratings and could potentially decide not to download the app.,0
This also gives the false impression that your app is not good even though you know that people worldwide are enjoying (or not enjoying) the app.,0
So I am suggesting that Microsoft implement a system to show a consumer all the ratings and reviews.,1
I understand there may be some issues with language etc.,0
Ratings and Reviews are an important part of an app store otherwise why would Microsoft bother having them.,0
"Ratings and Reviews are an important part of a developers promotion arsenal... after all who would you rather believe, the sellers ads or user reviews of the app?",0
Not all of us are the Instagrams of the world and depend on each and every ratings we can get.,0

"One possibility: Instead of having a top charts style listing, where the most popular apps are displayed to every phone anywhere, create a new form of distribution, where the results are randomized every time a user looks at the marketplace.",1
"Now, that obviously has the result of bad apps being near the top a lot, so you modify that with ratings.",0
"Highly rated apps should appear near the top more, and they should appear less and less frequently and the rating of the app dwindles.",1
"For example, my app is currently fairly well reviewed (4.5 stars).",0
"However, it NEVER gets good visibility because it isnt the best, which is actually subject to a very wide variety of opinions.",0
"It seems to me that all good apps/games should have a chance at decent exposure in the top charts, and waiting to be featured just isnt worth it.",1
Another option is to do this with the featured apps in the marketplace.,1
"Instead of ten featured games per day which all users see, it would be better for each user to see a random set of games each time the marketplace is viewed.",1
"In this way, every decent game would get a considerable amount of exposure each day, while apps that had a rough beginning could mend their flaws and become successful apps.",0
"There are a lot of reasons why this might be difficult, but I feel that with a little bit of thought this could be a very profitable idea, both for developers and for Microsoft.",1

Windows Phone 8 includes a new Map control.,0
It has a new feature to add a route that will be displayed under street names.,0
Street names over the route will be shown in another color and are moved to stay always in center.,0
To add a route to the map you have to create MapRoute object that accepts only Route object in its constructor.,0
But Route object does not have public constructor.,0
The only possibility to create Route is RouteQuery class.,0
This is a problem!,0
RouteQuery uses online service to calculate the route.,0
Apps cant show the traveled route at real time on the map (like jogging apps).,0
Because they would have to be always online and query the online service frequently.,0
It is possible to workaround this with MapPolyline.,0
But the polyline is shown OVER the street names.,0
Street names color stays black and not being centered.,0
Also if the new Map has route feature it should be usable.,1
Possible solution: Route class implements IRoutePath.,0
MapRoute constructor should accept IRoutePath inteface instead of Route class.,0

The current developer ecosystem for WindowsPhone apps is focused on individual developers or corporate developer accounts that typically distribute apps to the masses via the Marketplace.,0
Internal use of apps is defined as a beta test and requires a list of Live IDs designated to allow a certain set of users to download and use the app.,0
This is very limited and also time consuming.,0
"Ideally, a company may wish to dedicate a group of Live IDs as testers to be used each time.",0
"For this cost, a company would receive two unlocked WindowsPhone devices that could be traded or upgraded.",0
"This allows a team to use these devices for testing, as opposed to having to put company apps on their personal devices or hand their devices over for demonstrations.",0
The Enterprise account would also allow for distribution of apps at the organizational level - either in-house or to clients.,0
The Targeted Distribution approach doesnt seem to satisfy the need to sell or distribute from a company to clients.,0
It could also allow for a specific download key if purchases were made outside of the app Marketplace.,0
"Together, this level of support would cater to a market that would like to leverage the Marketplace in a unique way while having the tools and capabilities to develop apps without requirements of personal accounts or devices.",0

Texture coordinate transforms are not exposed for any effects that can be used by the Reach profile even though this is something the GPU can probably do cheaply.,0
A developer should be able to grant access to another app for data access.,0

Theres one area where Mango is a retrograde step when compared with NoDo : theme support.,0
In NoDo the user could leave the app switch the theme (i.e.,0
"Dark or Light) & return to the app which would now, in theory, respect their selection.",0
In Mango the users faced with an unholy mess because the app is only informed of the systems theme state at start-up.,0
"Developers have the choice of looking incompetent or ruthlessly picking a theme & sticking to it, thus rendering the ability to choose an overall theme pointless.",0

"Current Capability for Multiline Navigation via TextBox -------------------------------------------------------------------- The way it currently works is if you tap and hold, you get the I cursor to appear.",0
If you entered long lines of text that take up the width of the TextBox then you will likely instinctively find you can scroll up and down through the text by dragging the cursor above and below the TextBox.,0
"However, if you entered shorter lines, you will find that this dragging action does not work until such time as the I cursor makes contact with some text.",0
You will see it visually lock in to the text when this happens.,0
I believe this will confuse users and create unecessary friction for consumers to make use of apps that depend on multiline input that potentially is longer than displayed in half (allowing for the SIP) a portrait or landscape screen.,0
What Would Improve Usability?,0
Swipe gesture to control vertical scrolling when vertical scrollbar is auto/visible (latter is currently ignored).,0

I would like to see an agent like the scheduled task one that can be executed on a specific date and time.,1

It would be good to have a Video Chooser Task that works in the same way as the PhotoChooserTask.,1
"The reason for this is for users to be able to do things like apply filters, add audio tracks, crop out a relevant section, etc... of a recorded video and saving it back to the MediaLibrary.",0

I request that the MultiScaleImage library to be able to access isolated storage.,0

And finally memory is very cheap.,0
Some suggest that large images (even broken into tiles) are inappropriate for storage on a phone  that is ridiculous!,0
"If a user wants an application to host content, whether it be 1GB of music or 1GB of image tiles for a needed application that should be their prerogative.",0
Local MultiScaleImage functionality is available on iPhone so please do not put WP7 developers at a disadvantage.,1

The implementation of the SQL Compact was a pretty steap learning curve for me as i was used to the .net GUI Implementation that made it very easy to use.,0
I think there needs to be more focus on making it easier and quicker to implement these plumbing features as a lot of developers will be hobbyist and do not contain the time and knowledge required to implement of lot of these plumbing features.,1
Please make it quick and simple for us to get our ideas out there.,1
Detailed customization should be an after thought for us,1
"Allow apps with the interop capabilty flag in the manifest, perhaps via custom certificate, like Microsoft Office Digital Certificate for VBA Projects.",1

Add a tile view like in old Windows 8.1 Store.,1
"It was great to see at a glance rating, money generated by the application...",0
Enable recording of FM radio.,1
Currently in Mango these is a soft search button in the GUI displayed for context sensitive search.,0
The hardware button seems to always pull up a Bing!,0
Surely the design ideology was that the hardware search button was context sensitive.,0
If so then the soft search button is not needed and can be removed from being displayed if a hardware button is available.,1
This would free up more screen real estate especially as many application bars only have a soft search button on them anyway.,0
"In order to display more details on network connection, and to distinguish WiFi networks connected to.",0
"Allow filtering of marketplace results within categories beyond pay/free/top/new by adding filter by rating (ex: 4+), by price (ex: <$1.99), by number of downloads (ex: 10000+), or allow blacklisting of developers (or developer rankings) so spam apps and spam devs could be avoided.",1
Enable FM scan function in the developer API.,1
"I notice it is already available to the user in the 7.1 version (Mango) but I dont see methods in the API for scanning to the next signal (or seeking, whatever the term is called).",0
Allow apps to be hidden/visible in the store without having to go through the whole update process.,1
"Back to how it was on the old dashboard would be ideal, just a simple link to toggle between visible and hidden.",0
Handy for if you have to take the back end server offline so new users cant download your app and instantly think the app is useless,0
"In the new store is not possible to delete an existing app from the store(or if exist, it is really well hidden).",0

Some people have had other developers submit apps to the marketplace on their behalf for many reason.,0
They may have been in a country that is not supported for example.,0
More then one developer may have worked on the app and are now splitting.,0
Some people may sell their apps to others.,0
In all these cases it breaks the update cycle for existing users because the new owner would have to create a new app instead of updating the existing one.,0
"When I create a paid app with a trial option, many users blow right by it because it doesnt show up in the free category even though a light version of the app is free (via the trial).",0

"System supported application error reporting service, that would report back to developers application crashes and details.",0
I wish I could simulate multitouch on the emulator (ie: Pinch and zoom) with 2 mice.,1
Just like the picture extras ... itd be great if apps like twitter and facebook could register to be on the list of applications that a user can share a piece of text with in addition to email and sms.,1
This enables a number of cross app communication scenarios and lets the user choose how he wants to share that info,0
This enables caching of and usage of offline maps,0

The SVG data may be inline or loaded from a source (local file or remote from the web) There are few current tools for converting SVG to WPF/Silverlight-based XAML but they fall short when dealing with more complex SVG data. This should work just like any other kind of image data.,1
Some SVG files may be dynamically generated by a remote server - SVG data loaded in a XAML view may have internal named elements.,0

o Its a huge time saver to piggyback on those assets.,0
"For example, suppose you wanted to color a US map by probability of each electoral district voting a certain way.",0
This is easily done with some reference data & SVG from Wikipedia.,0
Problem is theres no way to easily manipulate this within a XAML app - I would hope that an SVG-renderer element would use similar hardware acceleration that the HTML5 renderers use - I would not expect to use javascript/css classes to manipulate SVG from a XAML app but bonus points if XAML styles could be plugged in - Manual conversion to XAML is an extra step in the workflow and leads to duplication of assets.,1
A designer may keep tweaking the source image and must keep generating that XAML.,0
That xaml would then need to be copied into a resource dictionary and cant be a separate file resource (can it?),0
The high-level ask is to support using SVG within a XAML tree.,0

There appears to be no way to deploy an app to a Windows 10 Emulator outside of manually doing so in Visual Studio.,0
"Without that, we have no means to wrap our own tooling to launch and install built apps to the emulator.",0

"Oddly with Windows 8.1 tooling installed and Windows 10 SDK, we can actually see the list of Windows 10 emulators listed in the AppDeployCmd output (and need to do some post-filtering to separate the 8.1 and 10 emulators).",0
"So currently, we can use the 8.1 tooling to get the list of emulators, but if we try to deploy to them theyll start up but app deployment will fail.",0

"An example of the second might be: I really enjoy doing crossword puzzles, so Ill type Crosswords into the search box so that I can find and download a crossword app that I play during my commute to work.",0
The Store search heavily favours matching the search term to the app name over matching to the keywords.,0
It would seem that the search algorithm has been developed to optimise results for use case one above at the expense of use case two.,0
"In my view, and I can see from the forums and user voice channel that I am not alone in this, the Store search provides a poor customer experience by not catering effectively for use case two.",0
It is my belief that the search algorithm could be improved to cater for use case two without adversely effecting use case one.,1
"Intuitively, if a user already knows the name of an app then it is likely that it is already fairly popular, and so would be ranked highly in search results without the algorithm favouring the app name.",0
"In addition, app names are quite specific and so searches for Facebook and Wordament should return a narrow set of results compared to searches for generic terms such as crosswords.",0

There are a lot of feedbacks asking to allow developers to delete/remove apps and IAPs from their Dev Center.,1

Would be great to be able to read my feedly feeds on ighome.com instead of having to go to feedly.com.,1
"So flipbook sort of did this, but they did it awful and i unistalled.	",0
"yes, i want feedly to replicate google reader... but I want it to do more.",1
Can you bring in my twitter feed and know which ones Ive already read?,1
"i.e. do that google reader/feedly does for RSS, but with twitter.... or facebook... or pinterest",1
"give me ONE place to consume everything, but only see it once (unless I save it). ",1
ohhh that would be awesome.,0
Feedly client doesnt support Android 2.1 so I was forced to use alternative Android apps.,0
I tried more than 5 on my Nook Simple Touch.,0
And all of them have the same problem when trying to log into Feedly.,0
After entering Google username and password I get onto the Moved temporarily page.,0
After clicking on the only link on the page I get an empty page.,0
Offering other ways to log in or even Feedlys own registration system might also help.,1
Every time I restart Chrome feedly mini appears on every web page.,0
I want to turn it off.,0
"Ive updated my preferences which works until I close the browser and restart it, then my preference is set to show it again.",0
I have tried the gReader and Press Android clients.,0
Both show we a Google login in a web view within their apps.,0
This is insecure because I cannot verify that I am not phished and that I am talking directly to Google.,0
Such a login process should not be allowed.,1
Login should go through the Google account stored on the Android device.,1
"Make the Safari extension open the Feedly page in a new tab/window when clicking the Feedly button, similar to the Safari GReader extension.",1
I didnt see anyone else suggest this but I would think it would be very simple for Flip Board to add support for your service.,1
I see no reason why they wouldnt because I know they transferred over a bunch of Google Reader feeds but they arent doing what feedly is.,0
Would be nice to have.,0
"Would love the ability to monitor specific pages that dont have rss feeds at set intervals, and be able to vary the alert options, such as getting an email etc when the pages change.",1
Thanks and please keep up the great work!,0
Can I only not find it or is it really gone?,0
"Since today I cannot send to Instapaper anymore, which was very useful for me.",0
(I am using Safari),0
100% of my blogs are music blogs and id say 75% of posts have soundcloud streams embedded into them.,0
to visit the sites externally for EVERY page is not very convient.,0
could u make this happen?,0
"Google Reader never did, but I suspect thats because they quit investing R&D into improvements",0
Allow us to import twitter lists and view them like regular feeds.,1
"Support login with Twitter, Facebook, Microsoft, Yahoo, VK account, etc.... and remove google account login support.",1
Allow Android app to provide an option to open within the application or open in a browser.,1
"Like a Send to tumblr button, and liking posts from tumblr feeds.",0
I assume there was problems with it but some of us really use it and it would be great to have it back.,1
So far this is the best feed reader Ive tried.,0
Please consider it.,0
Thanks!,0
"You cant use paste in the search bar/field and you cant use Feedly as a sharing option in other Android apps (Dolphin Browser, etc.).",0
It is really annoying to remember every interesting site until I can use a desktop computer.,0
"Please, please add an option to easily add content by using a mobile device!",1
Thanks!,0
Make a Chrome packaged app for Feedly please.,1
So I can launch Feedly from google desktop app launcher.,0
"Im talking about just integrating my stream / followed tumblrs, that is, reading not posting.",0
"I keep reading that feedly has tumblr integration, but cant find it anywhere.",0
I just want my tumblr content to show up as articles without having to add every single one as RSS.,1
"I keep reading that thats possible, but cant find any setting or even anyone explaining HOW its done.",0
"If it is indeed possible, maybe a short how-to in the help section is in order?",1
"If it isnt, that would also be great to have clarified somewhere, FAQ maybe.",1
Youtube video work fine on feedly but somehow vimeo video is not showing the content instead showing error #2048.,0
Take a The Verge for example,0
I use BeyondPod on my Android phone and it supported integration of sorts with Feedly.,0
My desire is to be able to catch up on podcasts either on my phone or on my desktop such that if Ive listened to a podcast completely from either source (i.e. from my browser at home or work or on my cell phone) that the episode would be marked listened to (or read) and disappear from the list in Feedly on any of my machines as well as drop off of my BeyondPod list.,1
Ideally if Feedly and BeyondPod could get together and synchronize the position within a podcast would be excellent!,1
"That said, as a podcast player, Feedly leaves a lot to be desired.",0
From what I can tell merely starting to play a podcast marks it as read or essentially completely listened to.,0
"Furthermore if I am careless and click somewhere else like to read another article, Feedly will stop the playback and go to the place I clicked.",0
It should warn me.,1
Finally a popout player would be nice for the audio/video of podcasts.,1
Chrome extension required too much permission(extension can access: Your data on all websites),0
Please reduce required permission for chrome extension.,1
work with soundgecko so anything I mark in feedly goes to soundgecko for readout,1
"Feedly should let users login through Mozilla Persona or Gravatar, which dont track users.",1
Persona is made by the makers of the Firefox browser and Gravatar is made by WordPress.,0
"I would like to change my log in for feedly so that it does not match my google account, which contains other personal data.",0
How?,0
I cba to leave feedly but I want to know what other people are saying and I want to be able to contribute without signing up to anything.,0
If a blog does use disqus the comments should be viewable and a reply able to be added directly from feedly.,1
make App/Extension/Plugin for all browsers with one click to add feed from any website,1
"You can subscribe to them in wordpress reader once you have access to them, but you cant use them outside wordpress.",0
"When you could connect your feedly to your wordpress.com account, why shouldnt you be able to subscribe to them?",0
I guess such a feature would be a big advantage for your service.,1
"Even though Im logged in to Google in the same browser, and Ive already logged in to Feedly with my google account and granted access to use what it wants, it still keeps logging me out then making me go through this process every couple of days - why?",0
"I wish as feedly pro user, if I save the feeds in Evernote I want to tag the note, not only the notebook but also the tag of Evernote.",1
The utm parameter added to your links breaks them at some sites.,0
Case in point: New York Magazine.,0
Creating a win win situation for readers and content creators.,0
Further thoughts: feedly could develop subscription options for content creators.,1
"i.e feedly handles payment and delivery of information, creator creates information and receives revenue.",0
Readers get access to contribution-only content.,0
Its been seen over time how simple barriers can stop people from doing activities that they want to do and that benefit them and others.,0
"I would like to see better integration with Google services across the board, specifically GMail, Google+, and Google Drive.",1
"I would like the ability to email articles with GMail, post them to Google+, and save them to Google Drive.; cause Google doesnt own quite enough of my soul, yet.",1
"Though this idea has been expressed to varying degrees with regard to specific services, like google translate, Ive not seen it expressed generally.",0
This option existed before.,0
Now I have to go the the source article to have the option to post to a LinkedIn group.,0
Its a relatively minor detail but it would be really convenient.,0
Import RSS from other readers,1
"I like it because of its built in browser and various settings for feeds and podcasts, which the Google Reader app didnt have.",0
Please consider speaking to the people of Beyond Pod to integrate with their app.,1
"Feedly is beautiful, and I would love to use it on my Windows 8 Phone",0
Allow publishers to trigger feedly to refresh feedlys cached version of their RSS feeds.,1
Feedly doesnt seem to notice when existing feed content for a date/time changes and refresh their cache.,0
Letting publishers trigger that refresh could be a work around when there are errors in the publishers feed.,1
add integration with Trello,1
"Evernote sharing in feedly seems to cause the Chrome Evernote plugin to sign out the user and then Feedly takes you to a web page version of Evernote, rather than using the Evernote plugin clipper to push it directly into the application or push it transparently to the web.",0
I just see a blank screen on IE9.,0
Since its my work computer I cant control the software upgrade.,0
If you dont fix that i will seriously consider droping feedly.,0
Chromecast support would be great so I could read my news on big screen.,1
I love how you have pintrest integration on your images - please consider adding GimmeBar integration as well.,1
The type of users on gimmebar vs pintrest is night and day.,0
great app!,0
gimme bar https://gimmebar.com/,0
As above,0
I used to subscribe to instapapers premium service and it exported all of my articles into a kindle book with a table of contents etc.,0
I feel like this might be easy to integrate with a service thats already up and running like SendtoReader.com OR I would gladly pay $$$ to have the option for Feedly to do it on its own and send to my kindle.,1
Feedly allows folder order to be rearranged instead of appearing in alphabetical order.,0
This is useful to me as Id prefer that a group or groups of feeds in some folders appear at the bottom of the all items view.,0
I changed the folder order via the Feedly web interface (organize) but the changes in folder order are not being reflected in Mr. Reader.,0
I logged out of then back into the Feedly account in Mr. Reader but the folders are still appearing in ascending alphabetical order.,0
Please enhance your API.,1
"I rarely use Google Plus, but there are few very interesting people using it whos post Id like to read.	",0
For example Linus Torvalds.,0
"On Feedly Android App, when I share something through email, it goes straight to Gmail app, when I rather want to use the Regular Email App on that plataform.",1
Make it possible for us to choose the Mail App we want to use!,1
As a feedly users we all know the pain of having to deal with truncated feeds.,0
This problem becomes more prevalent when using mobile apps that rely on feedly like Press on Android.,0
I would like to request the capability to run articles through the readability mobilizer before theyre inserted into our feeds.,1
This would help to solve the problem of truncation and poor article formatting.,0
I have missed the email subscriptions feature of the old (pre-2008) bloglines ever since they discontinued it.,0
I would gladly become a Feedly Pro subscriber if you offered something comparable.,0
"In a nutshell, you could create a bunch of random email addresses that you could use when subscribing to newsletters (etc) and then any emails sent to one of those addresses would show up as a standard HTML feed.",1
This was fantastic for those sites which offer more content in their email newsletter than their RSS feed (or lack an RSS feed completely).,0
A perfect use case for this would be to turn twitter/facebook/etc notifications on and forward those to these email addresses instead of having them clog up my inbox.,1
This could be used for any of these closed services which do not offer RSS feeds.,0
"The closest solution to this I have found is to use mailinator to create the throwaway emails (and they support rss feeds) but they also strip out all images/attachments/etc and generate plain text feeds, so this isnt a good solution.",0
Please consider adding this type of feature to feedly.,0
In iGoogle there was the Google Reader gadget.,0
One of the very popular alternatives to iGoogle is netvibes.com.,0
It would be cool if there was a feedly gadget for netvibes.,1
oEmbed is a format for allowing an embedded representation of a URL on third party sites.,0
Eagerly waiting on connection with Evernote!,0
There are my tags I use daily.,0
"The way Flipboard has implemented Twitter is that it grabs the content in the tweet and displays it, so rather than a user having to click a link to read an article or view an image, it simply gets the article content or image and displays it, with any text of the tweet acting as a caption.	",0
"It would be great if I could integrate my Twitter account into Feedly the same way, and have full images or articles displayed alongside my RSS images and articles.",1
SoundGecko is a great way to be able to listen to articles that you want to read later while in the car or on the go.,0
I use it every day.,0
I would love to have direct integration so that I can easily send articles to SoundGecko from within the Feedly app.,1
"Ive only noticed this on two feeds, my own blog and XKCDs.",0
In both cases what should be a float:left is actually changed in the code to a float:right.,0
See attached.,0
"This does not occur in Google Reader, where the original layout displays normally.",0
"Since the attribute isnt changed in Reader, I concluded that the problem is with Feedly, not the RSS feed itself.",0
Please enhance the new back up function (http://blog.feedly.com/2014/07/14/dropbox-vault/) and enable local drive integration.,1
"This would allow anyone to back up to DropBox, GoogleDrive, Synology Cloudstation, Microsoft OneDrive or any other cloud solution which has a local drive representation (in addition to allowing me to save it on a local machine)",0
I was logging in using my google credentials.,0
The Oauth screen is popping up and hanging,0
It would be nice to be able to add usenet newsgroup in Add Content such as comp.,1
something like AntennaPod (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.danoeh.antennapod) would be very nice,1
Maybe you could send them an API or something so they can add the option to sync with Feedly once GReader disappears.,1
It would be super useful if you are able to choose your own default email app.,1
"Not everybody uses the Gmail app as default... some others use CloudMagic, Mailbox, Inbox, K-9 and such",0
Please guys make it happen!,0
"I cannot login to my Feedly account using Windows 10 Microsoft Edge, even after deleting all cookies etc.	",0
I can still login with iexplore.,0
I cannot tell if this is a problem with Edge or with Feedly.,0
Google Reader allows you to get a public rss feed for each category/label used.,0
"Is very useful for sharing feeds, using it with wordpress blogrolls, ecc...",0
"It would be great, if google+ button opened an app on iOS(if it is installed).",1
"I used Google Reader to get the best posts from many blogs and share them through my own Blog, hosted in Blogger.",0
Google Reader had the option Send to > Blogger.,0
Thats the only feature Im missing in feedly.,0
"I can add my Tumblr blogs to my groups to read them but if I want to like them, I have to open the page in another browser window.",0
It would be nice if we could get the Tumblr heart right in the feedly page like how we can save for later.,1
Reblog support would be nice too but mostly just like at least!,1
I know of many folks -- including yours truly -- who use Feedly in conjunction with Pocket.,0
I noticed that Buffer and Evernote each have a keyboard shortcut in the Web interface.,0
"My feature request is rather straightforward, add a similar shortcut for Save to Pocket.",1
"for example if you want to have a feed with a particular tracked tag from tumblr, Feedly could create a feed.	",0
"The current version of your Chrome Web App does not behave correctly:; When you click the icon of a Chrome web app this should bring an existing, open window or tab to the front or in case of a window minimize it into the Chrome Launcher or maximize it from there.; Feedlys web app, however, keeps on opening a new window or tab everytime you click on it.",0
The current version of your Chrome Web App does not behave correctly.,0
"When you click the icon of a Chrome web app this should bring an existing, open window or tab to the front or in case of a window minimize it into the Chrome Launcher or maximize it from there.",0
That can really drive you nuts as there is almost no other web app that does this (Google+ being the stupid other exception of the rule).,0
Please fix this by updating the manifest.json file inside the app.,1
It should be enough to make the URLs match the actual URL of the open app.,0
"So in case you switch to https do use that in the manifest , too.",1
Currently if theres a link to an app in the Google Play store it opens in the Feedly browser instead of using the Play app which is frustrating.,0
This is just one example of many so it seems to be a problem with opening in the browser only.,0
We should have the choice!,0
"For instance, Feedpress cant see how many people subscribe to feeds through Feedly.	",0
"Please allow some way for RSS services to get access to that data, especially since Feedly is so big.",1
Right now its a black box.,0
Fix it if you can.,0
How about giving Feedly compatibility with If This Then That?,1
"Posting to Pocket via the Chrome extension is currently very laborious (opens in a separate tab, then loads all your Pocket stories every time!).",0
"Pending more straightforward integration with Pocket, how about allowing us to send our entire saved list straight to Pocket?",1
"You reader is nearly unusable with tools that allow mouseless browsing (vimperator, pentadactyl), please replace all links you emulated with divs (eg menu on the left) with real hrefs, so these are found by such tools.",1
"I add RSS source by click the RSS icon on the URL bar on Chrome, but with feedly i cant do it.	",0
"Please, make a way to do that.",0
Rendering is messed up in IE10 and 11.,0
"Im SUPER grateful that you guys got it working at all by July 1st, but this is something that will need to be fixed.",0
"When showing news as just title lines, in Chrome itll show 1 title per line, so to say, and the 1st line of the article is revealed after the title or upon clicking on it.",0
"In IE10-11, every news line is effectively 2 lines; 1 line for the title, then the 1st line of the article starts AND goes on for a full 2nd line.",0
This looks really weird and is quite distracting when trying to read my RSS.,0
"Again, super grateful you guys got it working somewhere other than Chrome (a life saver since I can only use IE on my Windows RT Tablet), but this needs to be fixed eventually.",1
"When saving to (Pocket in this case) a third party app, having visual feedback that the save is happening would be useful.",1
"I have performed a save multiple times, as its not always instant (a limitation of integrating with a third party I understand).",0
"Maybe the press to save could change the item color until saved, and the save icon could be disabled until it is saved",1
"Now that we have a wonderfully awesome Evernote integration, its time to make it easier to use.",0
"I have quite a few notebooks and would like to be able to select one notebook as a default so I can simply click the Evernote icon and voila, the article saved to my default notebook.",1
"When I send content from Feedly web to Evernote, the formatting comes across wonky and unclear.",0
"When I send it from other similar tools like Mr Reader, it comes across as an article and without the extra content from the website.",0
I wish to add content in Evernote with the clearest formatting I can so it needs to be better than Feedly currently supports.,1
So do I.,0
"If youre not going to, please explain, why not?",0
"What I really want are GMail-style filters for feeds, to automatically star or mark as read based on matches.",1
"A typical example: If article subject contains this week in, mark it as read.",0
"If article body contains My Name, star it and send to instapaper.",1
"I *think* IFTTT integration could get us there, with not too much in the way of additions, add trigger with pattern or keyword matching on subject, sender, body, etc., add mark as read as an action",1
It should be possible to specify actions in IFTTT that mark articles as read when triggered.,0
"I would like to do some action when new articles show in some categories, but I dont want to see them anymore in Feedly after this action is executed.",1
"Lots of blogs contains LaTeX code, to display mathematical characters.",0
"This should display as the characters themselves, rather than just as the code.",1
This would make it much easier to read philosophical and mathematical blogs.,0
(Pages created with Wordpress allow this.),0
This would allow you to minimize the rights required for users interested only in the reader.,0
"keyword filtering, deleting articles/authors not of interest, prevent unwanted articles from being grabbed by IFTTT.",0
Some Tumblrs I read have passwords on them.,0
Itd be great to have a way to add these feeds to Feedly by allowing us to enter the password once from Feedly,1
"Make it possible for me to open articles and links inside articles IN SAFARI, from within feedly.",1
I am looking for something like this but for feedly https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/checker-plus-for-google-r/lbmpmiibbncadgagnfcloaeilfhomemb,1
Create Delicious integration to allow sharing to delicious.com,1
The side area allows you to include your Facebook and Twitter feed.,0
"If youre using Feedly as your homepage, a quick overview of upcoming events might be nice.",1
Please let me sign in with an ID and password I chose (not my google account),1
Id like to connect articles with items in my calendar.,1
E.g. I read an article about concert and add an item to calendar attaching link to article.,0
Or I read an article about grant or scholarship and create calendar item for documents submission deadline attaching link to article.,0
Im limited to IE 7 on Windows XP at work.,0
All I get is the same white screen all the IE 8 and IE 9 users are complaining about.,0
Is there anything you can do to make Feedly work on IE 7?,1
"Hi Few day ago I have started using you excelent app, but one thing annoying me.	",0
My favorite web page which id http://lodz.naszemiasto.pl/rss/artykuly/1.xml is not acceptable by your app.,0
Could you fix it?,0
"Hello Feedly developers, here is a proposal on how to create a win win situation for readers and content creators.	",0
"Flattr is still not lifting, mainly due to a lack off content creators willing to register themselves at flatter.",0
Also flatters prototypish content search function makes it hard for users to find proper content.,0
Feedly has a user friendly interface with a pretty reliable search function and share options to several other applications.,0
It might be an idea to add a flatter function to feedly.,1
"Alternatively, a simple flattr-inspired donate function might do it. ",1
feedly pro readers sign up for the donate option where they can donate an amount of money for articles they liked. ,1
"The amount of the donation is up to the user, the user pays in advance into his pro-account and may spend that money for article donations.",1
"As a feedback, a graphical representation of number and amount of donations and how many readers have read and/or donated a certain article is shown.",0
"In this way, the current intransparent recommendation count would become more transparent.",0
All articles can be donated too.,1
"The donated money will be transferred to all publishers who are interested in getting donations, similar to unclaimed flatters.",1
Bloggers/Authors who want to claim their money do this by registering their rss-feed and bank- or paypal-account at feedly.,1
"After registration, unclaimed donations will be transferred from donator to author.",1
feedly keeps a certain percentage of the donation as an administration fee.,1
Benefits: gives readers an easy way to support the authors and content they like.,0
gives content creators an additional revenue model.,0
gives feedly an additional revenue model.,0
"opens up further possibilities around subscription, paid-only content, contributors influencing content creators, etc.",0
Feedly could re-invent the way we consume articles in the same way how Amazons Kindle Unlimited did with the book market.,1
An easy-to-use donate-function might turn feedly pro into a universal news portal for fact-based quality news.,1
This function might change the independent news market in a similar way as Amazons Kindle unlimited did to the book market and might attract both readers and authors to sign up for a feedly account.,0
"Anyway, the most important feature is to find the simplest way to transfer money from article-readers to article-authors.",0
Feedly could be the perfect platform for that.,0
"I have two twitter accounts that I use regularly, one for work and a personal account.	",0
"I often post to both from Feedly, but this requires a lot of logging in and out.",0
Integration with Tweetdeck would allow me to easily post to either account.,0
I often want to read articles at a later time in Safaris Readling List.,0
Would love to have a direct link to do this.,1
Do you think its possible to mod this little software Google Reader Notifier by Yonizaf (http://code.google.com/p/google-reader-notifier-windows/) to notify us when new Feedly feeds are available.,1
"Currently in browser and mobile version one has often to do two step navigation to go to original content (e.g. youtube rss for uploads, in browser and mobile version it embeddes video, which is not what some of us want",0
I prefer to see original content most of the time) so along with mark as read / save links there could be URL link which will drive to the original site.,1
Applies to browser and mobile versions.,0
It would be awesome to play all videos one by one like in a playlist but without a hassle of creating one.,1
I often have many short videos which I have to click individually which is pretty annoying when I want to do sth else and not touch computer.,0
Feedly is a website.,0
Luakit is a browser.,0
I *should* be able to use feedly in luakit.,1
"I understand that offline support is being worked on and cant wait to use that functionality, however since Google Reader is shutting down within weeks, and BYLINE reader is the ONLY offline reader currently available for commuters, it would be fantastic if you could work together... ",0
Unfortunately they only pull their feeds from google reader.,1
The Android app is missing a mark as unread option.,1
It would be great if you could add a link / bookmark right into your Diigo account while reading in Feedly.,1
"I am a blogger and I want to make it easy for people to subscribe by having a flare unit for them to add my feed to their Feedly, but I simply cannot find a working flare unit to add to my feedburner.",0
"And, I seem to be having trouble making one of my own.",0
Please create and host a flare unit and provide the URL for bloggers to easily add this option for their readers who use Feedly.,1
"I can use flipboard to access my feeds in sina weibo, but I like feedly better, so if it can be done in feedly, it will be great for me.",1
Now it shows 5 recent items which makes it unusable,0
I cannot see more and have to go to FB website anyway - so the integration is not useful at all,0
the button to subscribe to rss with feedly in Firefox actually does nothing,0
some articles include slideshows with article information that have to be viewed with a swipe action.,0
"Because feedlys swipe action moves to the next feed, its not possible to view the slideshow.",0
Either allowing a function to go to a webpage in your internet browser outside of feedly or using another action to view the slideshow,0
"Other similar apps have this functionality, it would be quite useful to my workflow, at least.",0
"Since you can integrate with Twitter, it would be nice to have my saved links across both platforms show up in a nice readable format in Feedly.",1
"Id like to have Feedly automatically detect YouTube videos in feeds, and if I save a post with a YouTube embed, automatically add that specific video to my Watch Later feed in YouTube.",1
"This way, I can pull up the YouTube app on my phone or tablet later and watch these videos on my Chromecast.",0
Make the Feedly reader browser extension more like the Google reader extension.,1
"Add a drop down menu of the sources with number of unread items in (), list the latest unread articles in a scrollable manner and add a mark all as read button and the link to the feedly reader.",1
"Footnote popovers, as used on many popular blogs and Wikipedia, display the footnote itself within a pop-up bar or text bubble right next to the main article text it relates to.",0
"In a properly formatted RSS article, the reading app will display the footnote inline and not require invoking the web browser and going online.",0
Can Feedlys RSS parser be made to not break this functionality please?,1
I want to open feeds outside of Feedly sometimes and look at the site it came from.,1
I prefer to use Chrome and it crashes constantly in Feedly on my iPAD if I browse beyond the article s page.,0
Its a more stable option that selecting Chrome as the preferred browser in Feedly.,0
Also we should have the choice... Im not going to leave Feedly - its a great app!,1
Just looking for an option that lets me list my articles from oldest to newest like I have it in the on the site.,1
Im looking for a consistent experience.,1
"I currently use NewsBlur, but Id love to transfer all my feeds via OPML to Feedly.",1
"Unfortunately, Feedlys OPML support is artificially limited to Google Readers exact OPML format, but theres no reason we cant expand it to handle NewsBlurs OPML download format for importing into Feedly.",1
"Let us configure the directory and file names when saving to Dropbox, with tokens like <year>, <month>, <date>, <feed-name>, <post-date> etc.",1
But the current add on doesnt add an option to the list of programs to subscribe using.,0
"Ive tried adding it manually but it doesnt work, and in any case it shouldnt be that awkward.",0
Also would be nice to petition firefox devs to have it as standard.,1
Please remove unsaved items from Dropbox (or add a preference).,1
Would also mitigate this:,0
Allow all your Saved for Later items to be exported as a bookmark file in a similar format to the Firefox and Google Chrome bookmarks export tool.,1
This will allow bulk importing of saved for later items into tools like pinboard.in,0
"It wont allow me to log in, the window containing the form is closed as soon as the form has finished loading",0
"I love Feedly, its a really well-programmed app.",0
Nevertheless theres one thing that annoys me,0
when I press a link in an article that Im reading on feedly then the link will always open inside Feedly.,0
There is no option to open the link directly in the browser (safari or -in my case - chrome).,0
"sometimes its necessary to open links in the browser, out of convenience and sometimes for usability.",0
"usually I end up opening the link in feedly, wait for the site to load, and then i go into the options menu to open the site once more in chrome.",0
it would be so much easier just to have a context-menu item that gives the option to open a link directly in the browser.,1
Support for reading latest gmail mails directly from inbox feed just the same as igoogle,0
"When I switch in IOS to another application (e.g. to translate a word) and switch back again the reader goes to a title page instead staying on the page I was reading, which is not pleasant.",0
Possibly some translation functionality might be useful.,1
"We can set the preferred browser on iOS, this rocks.",0
"However if I then click on sharing and google plus, it opens in safari.",0
"My suggestion is to honour the preferred browser, if chosen, when using more generic based web sharing services.",1
I do not need all the Pro features.,0
"Id love to pay $10/year just for evernote integration, though.",1
"This function is currently available in the Gmail and Pocket iOS apps, in which a button appears at the top left corner of the Chrome browser which will allow the user to quickly return to Feedly when they view a page in Chrome from Feedly.",0
More convenient than using multitask function.,0
Integration or support to work with Net News Wire for Mac and Reeder and Instapaper for iOS,0
"Recently, there was a change that forced you to use a Buffer account to share to social networks, such as Facebook.	",0
"Seems kind of pointless for those who dont have a Buffer account (nor want one) to have to create an account, and have it be the middleman between Feedly and Facebook.",0
I LOVED the way Facebook sharing was!,0
"Clean, at the end of articles, and available for comments before posting.",0
"If it aint broke, dont fix it.",0
Feedly allowed mailing articles through gmail directly instead of bringing up a mail client.,0
I want that feature back as I would like to mail my articles directly.,1
The G+ hack does not work for mailing lists.,0
"When I tag an article in feedly, i want the tags to follow when i export the article to evernote (with the built in evernote feature for Feedly Pro plan).	",1
"As it is now when i export, with the evernote-button, an article i have to manually log in to evernote and ad the tag again.",0
It would be nice if we were able to view content from Twitter embeds (such as images) in Feedly.,1
Some libsyn feeds dont link to the libsyn item but rather the audio file directly.,0
You used to be able to right click on the item in feedly and save it.,0
Now you have to open the file and use save page as.,0
Please fix this.,0
BeeLine Reader (full disclosure: Im the founder) has browser plugins that apply eye-guiding color gradients to make reading faster and easier.,0
"Over 85% of people find that these gradients improve readability, and the plugins work great on feedly.",0
"But the BeeLine functionality could be built into the feedly UI, using the BeeLine javascript library.",1
add Google+ as option for feed that appear on the left in the app and also in your main feed,1
"When we long-press on a link in Feedly or in a web view, were given the option to add it to Reading List, but not to Instapaper or any of the other Read Later services.	",0
"When you select a preferred RL service, it should also be available when you long-press a link so that you can send that link directly to your favorite service, rather than having to open the link, wait for it to load, then send it to Instapaper or Pocket or whatever you prefer.",1
"I have searched high and low - Google, DuckDuckGo, feedly.com (which redirects me to my feeds, from where there are no other links), PimpMySafari (dead link) Apples Safari Extension Gallery - everywhere.",0
"I see people talking about the extension all over the place - but for the life of me, I cannot locate a link to the damn thing.",0
The abillity to export an article or post directly to Kindle or/and other e-book readers.,0
"In the Firefox extension, selecting oldest first under change layout... doesnt stick.	",0
It keeps resetting to unchecked (so the sort is newest first the next time you enter that category.,0
Import google current feeds into feedly,1
Add ability to share whole articles to Evernote.,1
This option is very important when RSS feed contains only text excerpt.,0
make feedly more sandboxed,1
"Android 4.1, Feedly 19.1, Chrome.",0
I think its for open in browser or maybe share with chrome.,0
"Anyway, itd be great if this opened the currently visible article in the browser instead of the previous article.",1
Thats how it used to work and I think that makes more sense.,0
"Sometimes after Ive clicked into an article--into a Chrome tab--and then clicked the Back button, I end up at the Feedly apps top level, rather than at the article summary.",0
Im presented with the Feedly apps splash screen along the way.,0
"As is, one has to open each post one wants to read later.	",0
"Often I have little time and just want to scan headlines, and make sure the ones that seem important get into the readitlater pile.",0
Unify login feedly allowing access by more than one source (or facebook or Google or Microsoft or ...).,1
Just depending on what the user decided accounts relate.,0
"I would like the Feedly Chrome app to act just like the Google Reader one, shows how many feeds I have and I can click on them individually.",1
Add the number of followers to your subscribe button (like Bloglovin already does) to be displayed on blogs.,1
Provide the html code with your other buttons.,1
"Integrate Twitter cards on article preview page, so that when viewing an article that has an embedded twitter card with all its information, it shows the card instead of plain text.",1
"When I save an article to Evernote, the resulting note is the text and images, but not what the webpage looks like.	",0
"The Evernote Web Clipper allows to me save the full page, but I would love to be able to do this straight from Feedly.",1
"I currently use Pocket as my read later app, but was hoping to move to Evernote.",0
"Right now it takes 2 clicks and navigating to another tab for saving to pocket, it would be nice if its handled in the same window with pop-up , or just with single click.	",1
"Also, if its possible to override save for later to pocket.",1
Id like to have feedly integrate with bit.ly.,1
"Bit.lys bookmark function, combined with its URL shortener and usage information would be really useful when sharing from feedly!",1
"Please allow Chrome feedly (and other browsers feedly) to customize favourite saving tool, so that I can save to pocket with one click (and please also cut the settings on the pockets end for adding a new item).",1
Would be most appreciated!,0
I currently use gRead widget to see my unread count on Google Reader.,0
Its how I get notified that there is unread items while I am on the Mac.,0
"Essentially, Id like to see the ability to add All to an external application, such as Desktop Ticker by Mike Batt ",1
"This application and gReader Pro for Android is where I pull all my news in normally, and Desktop Ticker is now useless as of this morning without a way to pull Feedly (or Digg Reader?	",0
might have to check to see if they have its data into it.,0
I like the feedly interface more than the Instapaper interface.,0
I would like to read my Instapaper saved articles via feedly.,1
"I have Googled and found at the moment, Feedly only works on one web browser which is Google Chrome.",0
We are limited to one browser (which is Internet Explorer) in our work environment so we are currently unable to use your services.,0
Please can you give us a fix or enable your program to work in IE.,1
Other users who are using your program for work purposes will have a similar problem as it makes it difficult for IT teams to support more than one browser.,0
Id like to be able to save articles to MindSky similar to other integrations.,1
As available with their save tool: http://sky.mind.im/6301,0
"Its frustrating that I dont need to remember passwords anymore when Im using Safari but I need to exit Feedly, go to Settings> Safari>Passwords>look for the site>copy password>go to Feedly again and paste password.",0
Apply the awesome mobile app feature to the web interface!,1
I would love to be able to save directly to Pocket like I can on the android app.,1
all is in title,0
"when a term is added, should lookup for feeds in popular RSS Feed Directories in one go.	",1
This will present with more options to subscribe to.,0
"As a web developer, I do not like plugins that add elements to the DOM of each page.	",0
Can you use a traditional address bar button?,1
simple timeline were you can add content from twitter-accounts & facebook sites/profiles (in a own categorie?),0
"Im working on a feedly application and I want to add some pro features like in-stream search, but Im not able to test these because i dont have a pro account.",0
Obviously this should be somehow restricted so that this system cant be abused.,0
Feedly always inserts quotation marks in posts to Buffer.,0
Please remove the quotation marks or make Buffer post template editable like already the Twitter post template.,1
The use case is that Im surfing the web and I find a site that Id like to follow.,0
"I drag the url to my feedly bookmark, and Feedly adds the feed to my account (even better would be the ability to categorize the feed as I add it).",1
"The ability to let indigo read the title of the posts perhaps with commands to marks as unread, save even read the whole article Like an interactive radio",0
"You Recently added function and allowed us to save an article to; Evernote , thats great !	",0
"However ,  ( Evernotes service for China ) is not supported.",0
Please do not abandon market in China !,1
Please remove google+ requirement.,1
It would be great if chrome and opera werent the only options for opening up articles in.,1
"Due to the way your article popup is positioned, its close button sits directly above the side pane.",0
"Although my mouse click is properly sent to the close button, any mouse movement after the popup goes away, is sent to the side pane -- which causes it to intelligently expand and reflow the list of articles that I am trying to read.",0
Its really annoying.,0
I really love how I can browse the latest articles from all feeds on the iOS version but this doesnt seem to be an option on the chrome web app version?,0
I might just not be able to find the option so if someone else has anything to add then please comment.,0
Keep the awesome work up guys!,0
At some point can we get Google Keep integration to go along side Pocket?,1
That is if they have an API for it.,0
I have a jabber-Account GoogleTalk.,0
I would like to receive the headlines (as items arrive) to my IM-client.,1
"As soon as I log in online, your jabber-bot could return to 10 (20, 30 ... looking as defined in the settings) of fresh news headlines.",0
"If Im already connected, the bot could write headlines (with links) to me upon receipt of the news in my rss-subscription.",0
my facebook page is blocked by the plugin.,0
I uninstalled all plugins and I only reactivated the feedly plugin to be sure,0
If I have a feed in a folder named COOKING I would like the IFTTT ingredient entitled ArticleCategories to return COOKING.,1
Currently it returns nothing.,0
"Please make an app for blackberry playbook, because there are no apps that support feedly on blackberry app world for playbook.",1
This would make integration with other stuff (eg newsbeuter) possible.,0
This could make the Feedly OPML a canonical source of feeds for other apps that a user wants to use.,0
Reset the RSS subscribe function after someone uninstalls your extension.,1
The current uninstall leaves several settings in your about config and makes other changes which make it impossible to subscribe using Live Bookmarks anymore.,0
Ive had to switch back to Feedly just so I can subscribe to new feeds!!!,0
"For me, it actually provides a worse experience than the builtin browser, it brings Chrome to the foreground and opens the link I tapped in a new tab.",0
"To get back to feedly, I have to back out or go into recent apps.",0
"What I want is to be able to skim through my feed items and quickly open N tabs in the background, then go to my browser and read through them at my leisure.",1
"Having tap always open a foreground tab is okay, but probably better to be configurable.",1
"However, if in article/title view, allow long press to bring up a menu.",1
at least allow configuring the action for long press.,1
A lot of the RSS feeds I read force you to go to the full site to read the full article.,0
Lifehacker is a good example.,0
One thing that would be nice is the ability to be able to hit one button to open all of the unread articles for a category in new browser tabs rather than having to click each one separately.,1
"It would be nice to have a similar feature on mobile, except the way it would work would be to add all of the articles to Pocket or an alternative read-it-later app, Pocket all or something like that.",1
"If i want to subscribe to tumblr blog, assume /rss at the end of a link I paste, I now have to manually add /rss to links like http://spaceyspacelifeisneat.tumblr.com/ to subscribe",0
The Good read tagline isnt attached to my twitter posts when I schedule the posts through buffer.,0
Please add this feature.,1
Make it possible to link an article to your Facebook business page,1
"Right now Feedly isnt consistantly running across browser, this needs to be investigated and fixed.",1
"I work which adivertisement so i like to seeing new video ideas, but when i try to see VEVO video on the feedly i never can, only youtube videos.",0
Im constantly missing important content that happens in google+ as I dont check it regularly.,0
"The unfortunate thing about this is that if I had an RSS feed, Id include it in feedly but google+ does not offer this.",0
"It would be great if there was a way to see all of the content Id see in google+ via the API, and present it in feedly.",1
Being able to add a 1 click feed for Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/help/212445198787494/) would also be quite useful.,1
"I have noticed that it is difficult to add new blogs that I want to follow, including my own.",0
"When I search for emi ito illustration or the website, www.emiitoillustration.com, nothing comes up.",0
This is the case even when I have subscribed to the blog through feedly through the feedly button on my blog.,0
would be cool if I could view the basecamp progress feed in feedly.,1
I use the saved items while on mobile to flag items for review on PC.,0
It would be nice to have an indicator on the Chrome extension icon to remind me if I have saved items to review.,1
I need Huffduffer integration to send selected audiofiles from within my rss-feeds to this service.,1
Worked perfectly in Google Reader.,0
"It requires an integration with Google+ API, perhaps even cooperate with Google to make this specific data accessible.",0
IE 9 VERSION ?,0
"With IE9 and later in Windows 7 and Windows 8, you can drag a web site URL from the address bar to the taskbar and pin the site to your taskbar for easy access.",0
This makes for quick access to the site.,0
IMO it also helps with the brand of the site as the app is front and center for the user and feels like any other application.,0
"Web sites like Tweetdeck, Pandora, Facebook, Bing, etc. all include this functionality.",0
Most even incorporate jump lists into the pinned site icon.,0
"When viewing feeds from dribbble.com, I would like to have a Like button that is integrated with the Like mechanisms from their site",1
"When browsing a site with RSS and ATOM metadata header, the Chroma and Firefox plugin presents a transparent button to quickly and easily allow you to add this feed to Feedly.",0
Could the same be added to Safari.,1
Having a pop-up window open is pretty clunky.,0
Should just be able to click the icon and (assuming the account link is active/signed-in) send to Readability.,1
Furthermore itll have to be compatible with any RSS Feed i have in my list.,0
"For that kind of feature compared with the already existing and wonderfull feedly i would love to pay, because it makes my reading faster.",0
Recently the visit website launches the internal browser but it fails to load anything.,0
You can launch Safari from the internal button but then you have to bounce back and forth between apps.,0
This works fine on the iPhone but not on iPad.,0
"So I am using URL for recent uploads from a YouTube account, example: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=UUISPcad-6svNxgViVrsyvA;",0
"The page from the URL loads fine and shows recent uploads but subscribing to that URL in Feedly is missing out some videos, for example, I cant see video: Europa Universalis IV Common Sense Multiplayer 21 on the feed.",0
"It was uploaded yesterday thought Feedly shows some videos before it and after it, why that one is missing!?",0
"Not sure if thats YouTube only related, spotted it with YT.",0
"Thats really bad though, we might be missing some random content and noone would know about it!",0
Please use feedly users rather than googles users,1
I suggest a Feedly to Google Calendar feature.,1
I saw a TV Preview for a Show next week and I want to be reminded regarding this feed entry.,1
"It will be great if you will develop a Windows software, for those who would like to read their feed on the computer.	",1
Or at least make the browser extension useful (Firefox add-on has no use...),1
I want a one stop shop for all of these aspects of my internet life.,1
It would also mean that I dont have to try and search for the video channels im subscribed to on youtube within feedly.,0
I just click subscribe and they appear in my feedly.,0
"Same for tumblr, twitter and facebook.",0
"Something similar to flipboards functionality, except your feed reader is immensely better than theirs.",0
"Id like to plug Feedly into Macs RSS screensaver, but believe there is no way to do it.",1
I would like to be able to thumbs up or down videos from my YouTube feeds from within Feedly.,1
Please add Evernote support to the iPhone for Pro users,1
Why was it necessary for us all to have.,0
"First of all, I love feedly.	",0
"Id like to suggest reverting the change that was made in last version, regarding the safari browser stuff.",1
"Once in the article, whether within feedly or in safari I would press the back button top left.",0
Now the change has me reaching top right for the done button .,0
I use Evernote to store all of my note and picture from web pages.,0
It would be great to have some integration with that app.,1
The share icon can prevent a user to click on something behind even if its a small icon.,0
And i play some times with javascript and its influence by my script but in the extension bar it wont bother my script anymore.,0
And or you can make it a keyboard shortcuts,1
"Integration with offline translator/dictionary is highly needed such as goldendict, just add an icon to open the dictionary when pointing to a word in an artical",1
Add UI element a/o shortcut to quickly add reference to default Evernote folder w/t popup dialog or confirmation.,1
"Hi, I really enjoy using feedly (Nextgen) on Windows Phone 8, and was excited to see the workflow with Onenote, which i already use for all my other note taking.",0
I am running Windows Phone 8.1 Lumia Denim on a Nokia Lumia 930 with Nextgen Reader 6.2.0.17,0
API connectivity to all Google Apps for Work.,0
i just wish i could archive and group or send to another read later app from there to organize,1
Ive been a fan of feedly but am now losing heart.,0
Ive tried deleting apps and different configuration but impossible.,0
Why dont you test your blasted products before launching changes.,1
To import an OPML file still shows a link to http://cloud/feedly.com but the link is redirecting.,0
So prey make it clear that this functionality does not exist or tell us how to import a and OPML list?,0
"In order to listen to the podcast, I have to open the ogg file in a new tab and use the Firefox embedded plater/",0
Need support to add articles in Pocket directly.,1
"Like many others, I want to add some Twitter feeds as RSS feeds.",1
There are several older threads on this issue with some suggestions that no longer seem to work.,0
And can you please make the formatting support direct linking from the URLs embedded in the tweets.,1
Im wondering what the latest solutions people are using to read Twitter feeds in Feedly.,0
"When techbargain.com updated their site, it no longer worked with feedly.",0
"I can log in to Feedly, that works fine.",0
I chose Pocket as my preferred saving tool.,0
In the Pocket settings I only seem to have the ability to set a Pocket username and password.,0
I cant find any way to configure Pocket to use Google Auth.,0
I want to be able to just log into Feedly and not have it log me out if I log out of Google.,1
Bring back 1 tap saving to Pocket in iOS Apps.,1
Opening the word definition ins new windows does not make sense specially in an iPad.,0
Safari 7.1 seems to have broken the toolbar.,0
"Hi I go smoothly feedly web version and Android, but Windows 8.1 (desktop - not mobile - ) I do not get I log ",0
Flipboard has a awesome way of doing it (but your RSS management is far better !),0
Please add wiznote support as you support evernote.,1
"The RSS markup of these feeds identifies the author (e.g. dc:creator), use that to set the author attribute for the Evernote note?",1
"If author isnt available, than set author to name of the site or blog?",1
Could Feedly also set these note attributes when exporting to Evernote?,1
Perhaps other additional attributes?,1
"That being said, exporting tags as well could be a master setting someone could toggle on or off.; Basically improving the depth of integration with Evernote.",1
"Currently, Feedly Syncs with Google Reader.",0
"I just noticed that when i tried to view an RSS feed from blogspot, it automatically prompted Feedly to show the feed.",0
Im a web developer and I just wanted to copy the URL of the feed.,0
"If not, can you offer it?",0
Add integration with Toodledo,1
I think my subject says it all.,0
My hypothesis- what people read is important for a prospective employer.,0
Same as an integration for linkedin.,0
"Not individual articles, list as a whole.",0
Allow to pin things to pinterest,1
"If I could add individual users as a feed, then I could see their updates without having to scroll through Facebooks ridiculous wall.",1
The same for Twitter.,0
Just being able to add a Twitter account and view only a single users tweets would easily make Feedly one of the best Twitter platforms there is.,1
Please prevent duplicate saved items in Dropbox.,1
"Adobe Acrobat doesnt allow the user to set an option to perma-hide the bookmarks pane, and I guestimate that 99% of the PDFs Feedly Pro generates only have one bookmark (the article title).",0
Its annoying to have Acrobat auto-open a useless bookmark listing (one entry) in the reading window because it decreases the visible screen real estate devoted to rendering the PDF.,0
Feedly to Google plus causes the Feedly app to crash back to the home screen on Kindle Fire.,0
pointemy domain to feedly ?,0
"When we want to email news or feed records feedly do it via outlook, it is better to send it via gmail or make an option for it.",1
"I use RockMelt as browser and feedly wont load, he loads just fine in google chrome, but I would like to be able to use it with RockMel",1
Right now when you has X news articles and when you read them (by scrolling for ex.) and then click refresh - when no new articles badge not disappear - it remain with X,0
"Often, this kind of item needs to see all pages so that it can perform a limited task such as looking for RSS feeds that you might want to subscribe to.",0
Two problems: I have to click twice on a YouTube video to be played.,0
Each time I use the chrome app it asks to connect to Google Reader.,0
"I press connect, allow it, and it doesnt load the feeds, just returns to the same login page.",0
It works fine with Chrome & IE but when I click the Login link in Firefox nothing happens.,0
"include outsidethenest.net, please.",1
"When I get home I see that my home system is running v14., but I cant get to feedly.com regardless of what I do because the plugin knows better than me.",0
Even after I log out of feedly.,0
Please make it possible to go to feedly.com or make it possible to download an update from within the extension?,1
"Hi, I am not sure where i can claim problems.",0
"It is equal if i use my iPad or my iphone (different provider sim cards) , both are showing me the error that no connection is there.",0
"After that i downloaded other feedly apps like Ziner, they work without any problem.",0
"I wish to connect feedy with social networks (youtube, vimeo, tumblr, instagram,...) to synchronize the news and our favorites.",1
When can we command Feedly through our voice?,0
"Yes, your are right, too similar to Her, the movie.",0
But I think its necessary.,0
I want Feedly to be bigger!!!!!!!,0
Feedly mini is very nice plug-in for me.,0
"When you tap the Pocket or Instapaper icon, there isnt much of a visual induction that the article has been saved",0

It is supposed to be easier on your eyes.,0
"So far Im liking it, but the colors are sometimes off.; ",0
Any way you can fix this?,0
is this a problem that Hacker Vision needs to address?,0
Feedly is really bad at discovering feeds when given only the URL.,0
"Google Reader used to be able to do this with pretty much every URL you threw at it, and it doesnt seem to be terribly complicated.",0
"However, if you manually Google what the standard format for feeds is with Wordpress and try out ?",0
Which seems like something that Feedly might have been able to guess to begin with.,0
Chrome would gradually get slower and slower (a new development since Feedly asked to run the always-on tray app).,0
"Im sure its the app, because exiting it cleared up all the browser response problems.",0
not much else to say...include an icon for Flipboard,0
"Integration with other social media so I can read all the latest tweets, google+ updates and others from with the feedly app.",0
"Currently, some of the RSS items are lists of links.",0
"Expected behavior when I follow one of the links, find it interesting and click the Pocket icon, is to save the clicked-through article.",0
Take Mike Tysons channel for example.,0
"That string, UCdtNjOwfQpgVK0FyOeLyzrg, or any channel like that, doesnt work with Feedly.",0
"For about the last week, when I try to save, it forces me to re-login to Evernote.",0

when I click the icon it just says no unread articles where it used to show lots of articles I could open in new tabs.,0
"Second, why dont work with metro style on FB app?",0

When using Internet Explorer in Windows Phone 8 on Nokia Lumia 1350 (OS 8.0.10517.150) I noticed that pointing to specific section of any document (using #name) doesnt work from pages using frameset (doctype is correctly set to HTML 4.01 supporting framesets).,0

Since many devs these days use consider only WebKit while developing mobile websites these websites do not render good using IE(which uses Trident isnt much HTML5 compliant).,0

AnTuTu results show and score only 2D graphics and the whole system (as it is all 2D) gets rendered really well and almost lag-free.,0

"If you take the Geolocator class an set the DesiredAccuracyInMeters = 1; (Yes set to 1), then the altitude never jumps anymore!!!",0
Please fix the Problem in the WP8-SDK Fix Altitude Bug in GeoCoordinateWatcher and Geolocator when using in WP8.,1

"Now that native development is an option, its very frustrating that one cant debug the native code thats being executed on the device without a real device.",0
"Back in the Windows Mobile/CE days, Microsoft had a Device Emulator that would faithfully emulate an ARM CPU and would execute exactly that same code that eventually went to the device.",0
"This capability was essential for certain low-level tasks like native crash investigation, debugging stack clobbering scenarios, deep optimization with inline assembly (e. g. for NEON) and such.",0
Now that capability is lost.,0
Please bring it back.,1
Give Some API to find out these thing.Android and IPhone provide APIs to find out these thing.And dont give accuses because of security reasons.Android and IPhone is also secure.So work on it and Provide Some API because in Mobile technology it is very difficult to create application without this.,1

Please provide access for fm radio apis in wp8 and also the ability to change the audio route as currently the built in fm radio is capable of.,1
"I currently I use a wp71 class library to access the fm apis, but these does not provide the means of changing the audio route.",0
The ability to change to audio route for the MediaLibrary would also be great.,0
"The build in Music + Video apps fm radio switch to speakerphone is very nice, but when going back and playing music from the media library it switch to the headphones that had to be plugged in to enable the FM radio.",0
That is very inconvenient so it would be great if the audio route is always in sync between the fm radio and media library.,0
"The build in Music + Video apps fm radio switch to speakerphone is very nice, but when going back and playing music from the media library it switch to the headphones that had more",0
The method would be useful for developers who must deal with diacritics in multilanguage apps.,0

Thank you for reaching out to Microsoft Windows Phone Developer Support.,0
I see that you are currently developing within one region and now want to develop within Turkey.,0
Turkey being one of the newest opened locations.,0
"While we understand your current situation, we cannot change your region once selected.",0
"Since changing is not an option, you will need to create a new account within the Turkey region.",0
What we can offer you is the attempt to transfer your apps to the new account.,0
Please note not all requests can be completed.,0
But we can certainly attempt this for you.,0
"Since you have mentioned that you are a student account, this might require you to create to simultaneous accounts.",0
Each account must be active.,0
"If this is something that you would like to look into, please contact DreamSpark as well.",0
"Note, that if you have a Store account, the apps from that side will not transfer.",0

In my application that plays MP3s over the internet often when I start a track it stops playing after some time for a second or so and then continues normally.,0

"You should be able to select, from a drop-down menu or text box, how much memory is required for your app to run, or select what devices to test for.",1

Currently when using WriteableBitmap or decoding image data you have to do that on the UI thread.,0

Please unify the Windows Phone (8 / Blue / 9) and Windows (8 / 8.1 / 9) development compleatly!,1
It is good that you started this unification with the common core!,0
"But it should be common on all sense not just on general things, but also on UI XAML code!",0
There are a lot of patterns out there and it is not too hard to think yourself a good/new design pattern which unify the UI development for example.,0
It is ok that some things will be awailable on Windows 8/9 devices which are not available on Windows Phone 8 / 9 and vice versa.,0
Please support multi-segment path for this method or at least return a message giving more details.,1
change 1 bit in ZIP64 files to better comply with ISO-21320-1:2015 and normative APPNOTES from PKWARE in order to interoperate with other unzip software.,1
Your app must not contain or display content that a reasonable person would consider pornographic or sexually explicit.,1
Pornographic and sexually explicit needs to be well defined.,1
Furthermore Age Ratings in Dev Center Dashboard can be set per app according to the content in the app.,1
If the app fills out this information there it should not be taken down unless it has pornographic or sexually explicit material which is not well defined in store policies.,1
Would it be too much to ask for an API that wraps whatever mechanism is required to accomplish this?,1
A container for starting applications inside it on Windows 10 IoT Core instead of full-screen.,1
Providing separate x and y factors would enable it to be used on objects without fixed aspect ratios.,1
With separate x and y scale measurements both objects could be resized via pinch/stretch.,1
You can use Wireshark to inspect packets and see that queries having a class of ANY will be answered by a DNS-SD registration from Bonjour but will not be answered by the above DNS-SD registration.,1
Create an api that takes as an argument a command as a STRING.,1
And using that string the api may activate the command like cortana does when you say Hey cortana  MY COMMAND but without voice interaction.,1
It would be a huge advantage to support this attribute also on the App-object in the App.xaml-file and to make this the ultimate root.,1
Allow license assignment for an application to be tied to Azure AD group similar to how licenses in Office 365 can be managed.,1

Add PrinterController that was in WPF and WinForms.,1
Is there anyway you could make Windbg Preview available for offline downloading?,1
I would like to add Bixby to this list.,1
Why dont build a phone powered by Android but running customized by Microsoft itself.,1
Also if Cortana can read/reply messages from the phone why not link that API or process (not sure if those are the words needed for my idea) to the Messaging app that comes built-in on W10?,1
And also it will be great the Microsoft expands it services internationally like for example Cortana which it barely works in regions outside the US.,1
I hope that Microsoft pay attention to this and do something because I would like to see them making its way in the mobile department.,1
PD: All Microsoft apps should be native on the phone and you should also build up a mobile text messaging app that sync with the messaging app on Windows.,1
Could you please increase the maximum size or better: remove it at all!,1
Because of this I would like the functionality to only execute the SelectedItem code when a row is DoubleTapped.,1
My proposed solution is to add a RowDoubleTapped event directly to the UWP DataGrid class itself.,1
I would like to add a AnimatedHeaderedTextBox control to the Toolkit.,1
Get back the Offiline Symbols download,1
Would it be possible to enhance the loading control to disable navigation when it is running?,1
Most of the screen a wide so why not a horizontal layout for ColorPicker.,1
As a developer I want to see the screenshots and logs my customers are sending to me via the Feedback Hub.,1
Upon a person next logging into the device it would be nice to be able to have the app restart automatically too.,1
Id like to see a way for any UWP app to opt-in to being automatically restarted when the user logs in after a shutdown caused by an automatic reboot.,1
Having the app receive activation parameters that indicate the cause of the restart would be great for this too.,1
It would allow the app/developer to track why the app was restarted but more importantly it would allow for the app to provide a better experience that allows the user to continue where they last left off--with the app running and at a specific position in the app.,1
Nav View should be made a full proof solution for developers.,1
Nav View should be more integrated to the application so that the app is consistent.,1
This info should be mandatory IMHO.,1
It would be great if I could have two WebView each having a different user profile.,1
A command like ms-settings:utilities would be very useful.,1
For example an IsSelected property could be added to a TreeViewNode or a function like selectNode(TreeViewNode) to the TreeView.,1
So ever event handler must be like one touch behaver of user.,1
I think Microsoft should add a new property to FontIcon that combines FontFamily and Glyph into a single Uri Property call it GlyphUri.,1
Further I think nuget should maintain a set of tags on all their properties one of these tags should be Font-Icons so that when you click Download New Font its going to search nuget for this Font-Icon tag and list the packages for fonts from most popular to least popular...,1
Also I think NuGut should maintain User Comments for each package...and a 4 star rating...so that people can get an idea if the package is any good without installing....,1
Could you add the link for the feedback hub to the stores app review form?,1
I believe that the app review and report for developers should be divided.,1
Is it possible to add the note to the review form as following?,1
We need to open the window as maximized.,1
Please provide a way to configure the size of the window in the LaunchUriForResultsAsync method.,1
1) Take sample from here: https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-iotcore-samples/tree/develop/Samples/SerialUART/CS,1
4) Run application and set breakpoint ReadAsync method after line,1
(If you are also using PInvoke.Kernel32.dll please install the nuget-package directly to the UWP-project automatic references added by other nuget-packages like PCLCrypto add an older version verify the version of PInvoke.Kernel32.dll in your bin/x86/Debug build output folder it should be at least 0.5.147.53150),1
Ã¨ Microsoft should give us the possibility to download created app packages for failed certification processes for further debugging.,1
Suggestion for Pathicon DataUri Property for loading PathIcon from a Svg File instead of specifying messy vector strings nobody really wanted to put this stuff (F1 M 1612 202L 2016 116) in their xaml.,1
Another possibility is to allow DataUri to point to a text file holding this type of stuff: F1 M 1612 202L 2016 116,1
Would be nice if you could drag your file from the Project Tree over to a Xaml property requiring an ms-appx:/// path and it would expand to an ms-appx:/// path instead of a fullpath to the file on your filesystem?,1
This would be well placed in the task manager Performance tab a dedicated usage graph could be displayed for ML activity.,1
Would be nice if you could set the height of a TextBox using number of Lines.,1
And it can be made 100% backwards compatible with Height property in Pixels.,1
Also HeightLines > 2 should automatically set AcceptsReturn property to true to make it super easy to create a multi-line textbox in XAML.,1
The reason why its a good idea to add a HeightLine property is that it allows everything to be done in XAML setup the FontSize FontFamily and the Pixels size automatically to expand to match exactly 10 lines.,1
From now onward please add Sync() methods first and optionally add supplementary Async() method for long operations.,1
They are a welcome *addition* to the API but they should not be the *only* way to obtain data.,1
It would be good to have an option in xbox device portal so that we can see the javascript console logs like network logs in HTTP monitor tab.,1
Also it would be great if there is an option to inspect and debug.,1
for example I can add some text or anything I please on the side instating how far is this point to the current GPS location,1
In webview we can do panning by moving with 2 fingers and zooming by pinching smooth and fluid.,1
I think we should take it one step further and make Notepad opensource like Powershell so the open-source community can continue to add features to Notepad to become the go-to text editor for performing quick edits of programming.,1
It would be useful for Notepad to update from being a win32 app to a UWP one.,1
In keeping with current MS strategy of bringing cross-platform apps to the Windows Store making Notepad one of these would be extremely helpful,1
It would be convenient to have a SelectedBackground property for CalendarView.,1
Please check these links where users discussed similar issue.,1
1) InputPane should not be opened and closed again and again for each input element.,1
2) There should be option of preventing Auto hiding when getting focus through Tab button of InputPane just like PreventKeyboardDisplayOnProgrammaticFocus ( which is also not working in UWP Target Version 16299),1
Enable 2D application developers to easily use 3D volumetric content in XAML/Composition by configuring spatial scenes and manipulating transforms and skeletal animations.,1
Add a panel that allows to create a design with constraints (and support in Blend),1
I would like the ability to filter the call stack when trying to trace a function call.,1
Essentially make it as searchable as the solution explorer with the ability to add some exclusion rules,1
Bring WebView with Edge to WPF and WinForms applications,1
and now that i am in my 50s Iam still playing and building but my mother and her friends cant keep up with windows they are having a hard time finding there way around windows please give them back the old windows that they can navigate.,1
Now that Windows 10 has LTE support RCS Messaging API should be introduced so we can take advantage of this messaging protocol in our UWP apps...,1
Attach devices to another and ensure it full loading,1
Hot unplug and wait about 30s,1
Now my idea: All controls could have a default property for localization.,1
An attribute could be used to identify the default localization property for a Xaml Control.,1
It might be placed in a MenuFlyout in a Button in a AppBarButton.,1
Maybe at least if using the simplified FoldDown mode panning other file formats could be supported?,1
In webb for HoloLens Running apps section should have a column that tell the user account under which a app/process is running,1
I would like to ask Microsoft Developers to fix this issue and provide couple extra degrees of freedom going through the RDC.,1
I think we can support this by adding a simple constructor that takes in the same parameters as Initialize.,1
Add LoginHint as optional param to LoginAsync() and plumb through GetUserTokenV2Async.,1
So it would be great to have access to this values to stay on track with actual developments from other vendors.,1
Introduce functionality so that MAC address can be obtained programmatically.,1
Another possiblity is to add an Attribute to Button called:,1
if custom tiles are being displayed get the watermark(s) associated with them).,1
Since we are passing a string via the x:Bind attribute to some UI controls it would be nice if we could make the binding to a ReadonlySpan<T> so we avoid allocations.,1
You could rename the Windows 10 Mobile to Windows 10 Watch and you could stop making the Lumia mobile phones but you could start making Lumia Smartwatch with Windows 10 Watch,1
It needs to work as good as the one available in winmm.dll,1
Please add a semi-automated test queue mode to Driver Verifier where you can select a group of drivers and then have Driver Verifier test them one at a time moving down the queue one position with each reset or reboot.,1
An automated test queue would be wonderful in a situation like this.,1
Please look into how musicians and developers use MIDI and what we would like to be able to do with devices like the Surface and prioritize giving us the ability to innovate here.,1
The SwipeControl control should support mouse input as well as touch input.,1
I personally would like to be able to have a similar arrangement in my own apps but currently am unable to do so.,1
 - resize the windows explorer window to something like 300px to 300px,1
To fix it just resize the window to a bigger proportion of the screen when is not fullscreen and then maximize it again.,1
Add an option to let user do so.,1
It might make sense to have that option in Task Manager since it is the tool to control startup tasks in Windows 10.,1
Adding an image editor to CaptureElement control with these options: - Ability to save captured image as predefined image types (.jpg .png...etc).,1
How about an option to automatically delete the automatic checkpoint when the machine starts?,1
Add store uri schema like ms-windows-store://assoc/?AppExt=%q to search app extensions,1
It would be useful if this feature can be supported in Windows 10,1
I want the screen setting to be an option where I can set my preferance as a default.,1
Itd be great if we could chain functions together in x:Bind to create more complex expressions.,1
Rather than writing a specific function for this purpose itd be nice if it could be composed of individual pieces that can be combined in many more ways.,1
It would be good if we could submit utility tools to the store as there is no way to perform these tasks without admin.,1
Maybe warn the user when downloading the app or more stringent verification process for these apps but dont block them completely as youre hurting both devs and users.,1
With the publisher in the manifest locked to the developer name as well this should be implemented to make UWP apps much easier to distribute outside of the store.,1
Please improve the app submission process for internal/beta testing:,1
provide a lock to the tiles so that the tiles wont get collapsed accidentally.,1
button to right click and left click in the touchpad of continuum control display in mobile will be very helpful.,1
I have more than 20 apps in the store and would like to see all downloads of these 20 apps as a number.,1
But I hope my suggestion will be passed to where it can be the most helpful.,1
Similar to how Cortana handles text messages it would be nice if Cortana could draft an email onto Outlook for the iPhone.,1
The second insight I would like to provide for feedback is on the Cortanas speech recognition on Apple iOS and Android and user input.,1
However I would still appreciate being able to see a text message notification I have received on my iPhone from Cortana.,1
VR is not just wanted for gaming but for business apps too.,1
Suggestion: If the returned StorageFile class could not provide the actual entry of the choices selected by the user maybe the FileSavePicker could do it with a read-only property or method after the user confirmed the file.,1
M$ could try again to develop great software again as many years before which your customers want to install themselves because its just fun to work with and it brings great benefits to users.,1
The could start with small things like this feedback Form which is annoying too.,1
TrySetWallpaperImageAsync only supports a primary display rather than allowing the wallpaper to be set for any attached displays.,1
Add a switch statement for XAML which allows app developers to modify parts of a layout based on a value.,1
I would like to add the functionality myself or contribut if somebody could help me.,1
I think MS needs to provide more support for schools thinking about cloudbook using Windows 10s.,1
Id like a user voice where we can request certain software be added to the windows store.,1
Id like students to be able to install Scratch and Sketchup for example.,1
But it would be good for MS to approach in reverse based on school feedback,1
Update apps same time as IOS and Android updates theirs.,1
Include gestures that could allow users minimize apps for example with three fingers.,1
2. please set some heat sensing app by default in your Windows before it is too late.,1
Set a multi alarm software so that it can cope coming world situations.,1
Let us make a different type of OS which can understand and not only communicates with the user.,1
It would be extremely helpful if we could create a custom dictionary/word list/constraint as we can already with Speech recognition as it was possible in the old Microsoft.Ink API:,1
Please add windows update to default rules!!,1
Please un-hamstring Windows 10 and support Process Isolation for Containers.,1
Please allow that API in in background.,1
Microsoft should re-enable the Windows Bridge for Android.,1
Get public tweets without users authentication,1
Take any XAML page add a button to it and bind it to any normal as in not a command on the view model.,1
Compile the app and the Xaml compiler throws the exception.,1
With proper hooks many different scenario variations could be achieved.,1
Lets say there is a app which display news stories.,1
In my opinion developers should not have to do this to prevent multiple unintended events from a control.,1
We need a fix to ensure that the contol stops forwarding click events after it has been clicked multiple times without manually adding code to each and every async handler,1
Closing the StreamSocket (by disposing/deleting it) should stop all the pending asynchronous operations reads or writes.,1
It would be nice it there was an API Discovery endpoint.,1
Adding Visibility property on Expander and making the header Invisible will make the panel looks like it is sliding into the view.,1
Allowing UWP access packaged COM will eliminate this overhead allow simpler architecture and allow re-use much more traditional win32 apps.,1
Hi - you really need to fix the Xbox App store.,1
At the very least publishing on Xbox should be an opt in function when publishing - not an opt out one.,1
It would be nice if you also ported the ads into UWP APIs so that they can be used with Desktop Bridge apps.,1
Please add WMI support on UWP.,1
These APIs ought to be allowed for any UWP application but are most useful when working with runtime code generation:,1
Id like to see an API to create virtual MIDI ports built into Windows.,1
The Surface touch screen has tons of possibilities as a MIDI controller but this currently requires installing a 3rd party driver which is not a great end user experience.,1
Built in RtpMIDI would be nice too but at least this would be achievable without a kernel mode driver if we had virtual MIDI ports.,1
Allow UWP applications to tick a box in the .appxmanifest declaring it as a full-trust desktop application.,1
Prevent full-trust apps from targeting phone and Xbox if you have to.,1
If its an issue virtualize the registry as with the Desktop Bridge.,1
Look the concept of UWP apps can run on your phone (RIP) and your Xbox while admirable isnt practical for most applications.,1
Show a notice to users upon installâ€¦ more,1
It would be nice to have an attached property for ScrollViewer to set middle click scrolling.,1
Code would be useful in adapting to Bluetooth applications.,1
Check the Create date on the file.,1
Wait one minute (so the clock shows a new minute) and the run the code again.,1
If you go into the Explorer and delete the file and create it (in explorer) with the same name the create date is correct!,1
Following the comments on the blog post for AFUNIX it would be nice to see SOCKSEQPACKET and/or SOCKDGRAM support.,1
I would like to vote to have this feature be configurable in settings allowing users to disable this feature.,1
Please add support for Cryptuiwiz API to handle timestamp-reply,1
Cant the reason of revocation of extended execution be a little more specific than SystemPolicy (ApplicationClosing ApplicationSuspended...)?,1
In UWP Project follow XAML code make a Win32 Exception when minimum target is build16299.,1
Allow copy&paste in settings pages for path instructions AND especially in Failure/Error outcomes ... for self repair fix research/lookups.,1
It is possible to disable suggestions in the settings but I guess apps should be able to disable this themselves.,1
will be possible to share the roadmap on the LCOW improvment ?,1
Grouping : another optional feature to enable grouping on basis of a string property of the items.,1
Search bar : a top search bar attached to the control which can be enabled/disabled with a boolean property.,1
One of the problems in here is Unity code which is mostly made to be single-instance but it would be great to have support to launch multiple instances of the same app.,1
Id like to add ItemClick event to the Carousel control to be able to use it as Item listing control with the ability to click on items like in the GridView and ListView.,1
So please remove this restriction.,1
If this is a privacy constraint then please consider to add a capability that can be declared in the app manifest.,1
Based on this it also could notify the user at first app-start like it is done with the camera access.,1
MarkdownTextClock should provide LinkCommand alongside LinkClicked event,1
It would be good if TextBoxRegEx will be automatically delete letters at input like the TextBoxMask.,1
Maybe a new ValidationMode type would make sense here.,1
Can you add the 3D Viewer object that is used by Paint 3D and Mixed Reality Viewer?,1
Include the mouse and keyboard support.,1
Make it available for .Net WPF also and via nuget.,1
Please add an overload to create a MediaStreamSample from a D3D Surface.,1
But it would be even better if we could configure the compiler somehow through a special screen in the properties or through an optional configuration file.,1
In such a configuration we could enter for example default binding modes for specific dependency properties like for example TwoWay for TextBox.TextProperty.,1
1) Get rid of the [EmailMessage.Body] character limit.,1
2) If you have such limits publish them in the API docs.,1
3) The aforementioned forum post suggests using a remote API as a work around.,1
Please give developers the option to not participate in the upcoming sets feature.,1
Recommendation: ContentDialog should do the locking so that the user does not have to.,1
Recommendation: add a parameter to ShowAsync that positions the dialog relative to the main window of the app (centered left right bottom).,1
Since only one ContentDialog can be shown at a time a lock is needed (such as SemaphoreSlim(11) or a sequential queue of TaskCompletionSource).,1
But it would be nice to choose what elements get discarded first in case theres isnt enough space on the tile.,1
When declaring a custom Template for ContentDialog the template root must contain a Border with x:Name=Container otherwise the ShowAsync method will throw a System.AccessViolationException.,1
So I propose a download archive for Windows Insider Preview SDKs where we can download earlier versions of the Preview SDKs.,1
The expected behaviour is that when you click on the Primary or Secondary button in a ContentDialog then focus should be switched to the button concerned - otherwise x:Bind bindings wont update.,1
Please make registration posible for Moldova.,1
Please extend KeyFrameAnimations/ScalarKeyFrameAnimations to makte them pausable and resumable.,1
In MediaComposition add transitions between two clips on timeline e.g.,1
I think its good if RotatorTile has an indicator which shows what index is selected or maybe another control that can be attached to RotatorTile.,1
The panorama mode is beautiful and if only we could have a button to call the API from inside our Apps it would be great.,1
Thats why Im suggesting a specialized textbox for numbers.,1
Allow entering negative values,1
Allow entering decimal values,1
Format the text with a specific number of decimal place (i.e.,1
Im suggesting a textbox with the following feature:,1
It should return DOM element and coordinates and in case of image also the raw bytes.,1
At least receiving ScriptNotify events should be possible on http and without adding ApplicationContentUriRules in Manifest so that we could atleast have a way to do it on our own.,1
Switch the default to LF style line endings in the whole operating system!,1
There are situations where you might want to interrupt navigating away from a page when using NavigationView.,1
Please provide this same information on the Usage page.,1
It would be nice to be able to specify an ItemsSource and automatically populate it with MVVM.,1
In short we need a UWP alternative to ShowcaseView (https://github.com/amlcurran/ShowcaseView),1
There should be a Machine Learning SDK smilar to Apple CoreML,1
UWP should include a Augmented reality SDK simlar to Apple ARKit and Google AR Dev Kit,1
Could you add this to the list of UWP APIs supported in Desktop Bridge?,1
I really need to be able to programmatically restart my app.,1
Please fix it to support hiding PivotItems correctly especially during data binding when you cant simply add/remove it from the Items collection.,1
Please make ESENT (Jet Blue) technology open source and available on .NET Core and Xamarin for operating systems other than Windows.,1
New control to add multiples tags with close button and auto suggestion functionality.,1
Please add AllAccountsReadWrite to UserDataAccountStoreAccessType in order to allow to creates calendars on remote calendar providers,1
Provide funtionality similar to CurrentAppSimulator class found in Windows.ApplicationModel.Store namespace.,1
Another solution could be simply extend Office Store in order to publish VSTO add-in.,1
Please add reveal effect on each item on the listview in the hamburger menu control as per creators fall update.,1
The possibility to make optional packages plugins with code for in-process with C# and/or VB.net instead of C++.,1
When I make store listings for several languages I would like to be able to just right click on a listing then copy it and edit not .be troubled with details on .cvs and excell.,1
also would like to see when exactly a listing was updated.,1
Please add to UWP BLE API methods to interrogate BLE stack connection settings.,1
You may wish to consider my FlipPdfViewerControl for inclusion in the toolkit.,1
It would be good to see support for setting a GridView inside a ListView which has the ability to add columns.,1
So your are not able to suggest a folder or file to the user by a path-string.,1
What would be helpful is to have a service in the toolkit to get an azure ad token.,1
Having access to the Visibility of the System Back button is good but there are some scenarios where I think it would make sense to have a Disabled state for this button which could be toggled by Devs in certain scenarios.,1
It would be nice to have a way to automate update/upgrade Bash Ubuntu on Windows 10 that does not require to start Bash.,1
You should update all the constants for the paper sizes for example constant for CR80 or business card and POS receipt paper wasnt stated but you wrote other sizes are being reserved .,1
Please allow generic classes to be base classes of XAML pages/controls.,1
Obviously I would expect in point 3 that neighboring files should still be available (but maybe slightly slower).,1
Allow WinAppDriver to switch context from native to webview.,1
Imagine writing text directly into the TextBox or RichEditBox canvas without the Ink-Keyboard-Overlay.,1
(By the way speech recognition should be handled the same way).,1
So come on all the APIs are already there :) Give Windows Ink a boost.,1
Would be a lot more intuitive useful and less distractive then the current overlay.,1
Please make sure the P/Invoke either points to a Windows API allowed in UWP applications or a native DLL that is part of the package.,1
If for some reason your P/Invoke does not satisfy those requirements please use [DllImport(ExactSpelling=true) to indicate that you understand the implicationsâ€¦ more,1
Move from OneDrive SDK to Microsoft Graph.,1
Add MSAL support for v2 auth model.,1
Could this not also be provided in the UWP toolkit for inclusion in UWP apps?,1
Add a custom CalendarView control with more personalization options than the one included in the SDK.,1
 - Individual CalendarMonthView control so that if you want to display standalone months you can (maybe you display a grid of 4 months etc),1
I think in first case must be fired ButtonPressed event too like it happens on phone call.,1
It would be very useful to be able to immediately release the memory held by a UWP BitmapImage (which can be significant for large images).,1
Please make it possible to locate at the other three corners.,1
We need backward compatibility for XAML just like Android for example we can just use NavigationView without any conditional check at all.,1
Please add support for Composition Visual to handle pointer interactions.,1
It would be nice to have a UWP(or Xamarin) Community Tutorial where devs can contribute to the tutorial and make it up to date.,1
Create a Cordova plugin to enable IOS and Android hybrid apps to use Project Rome features.,1
I would really like to switch to UWP for development however Im not able to elevate users to install a UWP app that Win32 apps wouldnt have any problem just downloading from a network drive.,1
And also in full screen I would expect transport controls to ignore safe area...,1
Could Microsoft not add a padding reflecting the core window bounds to the full-screen window only instead of manipulating a grid by name?,1
I want the transport controls semi-transparent area more,1
Add Tumblr Service Too,1
We could also be able to start tracking packages directly too.,1
Consider a full screen application where youd like to temporarily control that brightness.,1
Please extend the API to run on desktop and mobile devices not in embedded mode.,1
It would be better if it was as fast as the WebClient class used in a desktop application,1
Both problems could be solved by adding GroupStyle.ItemTemplate.,1
And virtualization could be optimized as well by using container cache per group.,1
imagine a image viewer where you have one group Folders and one group Images.,1
Folders must of course use a very different item template than Images.,1
I want to see a better Windows Store first where my apps can be found.,1
Please give the highest priority to improve App Discoverability in Windows Store.,1
Apps must be found by keywords.,1
It would make sense that the app be published to the private store and users who have not been allocated a license should have the ability to request a license rather than just getting an error message.,1
For events the target method must not be overloaded.,1
Add a control that reminds users to rate your UWP app after a certain amount of time or app launches.,1
Depth tests are needed for fast skipping occluded pixels and depth reads in the shader are needed for calculating particle opacity (to make them soft).,1
 set depth writes enabled or disabled set other state changes make the draw call,1
In my opinion the D3D11DSVREADONLYDEPTH is really useless and should be removed any state validation for reading and writing to the depth texture should just check for D3D11DEPTHSTENCILDESC.DepthWriteMask in each draw call.,1
However to dont sacrifice performance those validation checks should be performed only in debug mode D3D->SetExceptionMode(D3D11RAISEFLAGDRIVERINTERNALERROR) and in that case the draw call should still be allowed but it only should issue a debug warning: writing to depth and reading from it in the shader may produce undefined results,1
You should trust the application to let it manage the correct state changes on its own without introducing artificial limitations and sacrificing performance.,1
This would result in smaller memory usage faster performance smaller cpu overhead / power usage longer battery life.,1
You will dont have to do these checks if this artificial requirement is removed from DX11 API.,1
Add ability to conditionally trigger a keyframe animation from an expression animation in order to support more complex animation scenarios.,1
Camon we need a service status page with we have issue were working on.,1
We already have the PullToRefreshListView in the toolkit so we can also integrate this functionality into the control and change the name to something more suitable like ListViewEx and have both of the functionality in a single control.,1
Please make the control usable in an app.,1
Make a menu with information about the files being locked by an application,1
It would save a tons of space to only have one small SVG for a simple icon rather than a dozen large png files.,1
Add eyedropper ability to pick color outside of the UWP app.,1
There should be a form developers can fill out to request expedited review.,1
It would be useful if this limitation were removed allowing physical web support to be developed using windows alone without requiring additional hardware resources to publish beacons.,1
Can we please improve the situation by adding missing API,1
For my work app we wanted the app to launch maximised.,1
The closet option is to launch it FullScreen but that obscures the task bar.,1
Allow app to launch URI with http schema in default video or audio player (not only store player win32 apps support will be great).,1
What would be really helpful is to provide an event (maybe something like DirectManipulationCompleting) that would fire as soon as the pointer is released (e.g.,1
Allow to register Background Tasks to be registered when die App is first installed from store or side-loaded without having the need to start the app first.,1
We need something like an InstallationTask.,1
Allow their to be faster response times for contacting App Store after submitting feedback link found at the bottom of the certification report after having your app rejected.,1
In Japanese input the font style should be applied to the left character.,1
Itd be great if the Slider control could have a TickOffset property to make the tick marks not start at the left-most edge of the control.,1
It would be nice to be able to easily create rounded or circular buttons in UWP without creating custom control template.,1
Allow us to withdrawal the money because we dont know when we can reach the threshold USD 200.,1
This can be really helpful if you want to easily create a Multi-Lingual Cortana Experience if you use RESW.,1
So we hope that UWP Image control and ImageSource can support more and more pixelformat like as WPF .NET Framework.,1
Example Page: (App1 should be configured to use Dark theme),1
To recreate paste the below XAML into a blank page and run (be sure the app is configured to use Dark theme).,1
Accessing this information through an API would be useful for creating automated KPI reports.,1
As a Windows developer I would like the site to be improved to give a reasonable performance.,1
Create new user control with ability to selecte date and time something similar to https://wpftoolkit.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=DateTimePicker&referringTitle=Home in WPFToolkit,1
Please add HeaderedContentControl to the community toolkit.,1
Would like to see the possibility to add a search bar to the master details view that filters results in the master pane.,1
Download.GetPercentage to get the download compleated percentage so that it can be used for creating ProgessBar,1
Should support Background Download,1
Allow the WebView to display URI from the applications local folder.,1
Raise single events (but its bad for performance),1
Raise reset event,1
e.NewItems but simple pick the first one.,1
So please allow UWP apps without .NET Native!,1
I wish the InterstitialAd will have built-in animation at least a fade-in effect when it shows.,1
A better option would be to add a new ROLE option for the accounts to indicate which accounts can raise support issues.,1
It just needs the /context command that returns the current context name which could be hard-coded as NATIVEAPP.,1
It would be nice if the driver returns correct size and position so that I dont have to guess and click through the tree to find an element.,1
User should be able to style the Carousel items like we do for ListViewItems/ListBoxItems.,1
User should be able to write style for all the ViewState like Focused Selected UnSelected Normal etc.,1
We need a way to save documents generated and populated within our apps to PDF or XPS.,1
It would be nice if there were an option somewhere where you could reboot your system straight into the BIOS menu.,1
Please can someone implement this line of code and let me know if if is already working?,1
Add shadow option to XAML UI Elements.,1
Please add BTHPROCOL2CAP to allow us to use a lower implementation...,1
Could you add support of Xamarin.Forms to the Project Rome SDK?,1
So please before you completely remove SuppressSystemOverlays make sure theres a way for us to force the status bar on and off even when we have entered full screen mode.,1
With SuppressSystemOverlays you can still force the status bar to show using StatusBar.ShowAsync.,1
Please provide with more information or planschedule.,1
Release the SharedUserCertificates for individual developers,1
trigger animation based on scroll position or percentage while we scroll/pan in UWP (C#) like many web ui component as superscrollrama.js,1
Since something like this would pretty much be aligned with the whole motion theme of the Fluent Design System I think it would be great if you could support it in future builds so we could use it with other Composition APIs to add new visual details and effects to our apps that are not possible at the moment.,1
bring RIP Silverlight deepzoom control to UWP control and pivotviewer too with win2D capabilities,1
My suggestion/idea is to reduce the development time & effort needed for ASP.NET web application.,1
Typical problem here would be deployment(Installationupdate) of the UI application to client machine But if we simplify this process of deployment like having the rules that the UI app should be only one obfuscated executable file It should not depend on reference libraries.,1
This UI should get loaded on client machine as the user types in url in windows10 task-bar which has the search boxthus removing the dependency on browser for web applications.,1
The downloaded application should not be taking much space on user machine and it should not require installation and it should not require user to double click open but it should open as the user types the url in the search box in task-bar.,1
This UI application should have pure UI logic with all xaml files instead of html to support running on all devices and all OS (linuxwindows 10 onwards).,1
It seems StorageFolder.CreateFolder does not support multi-segment path.,0
Windows.System.RemoteSystems.RemoteSystem does not provide meaningful data for Xbox.,0
And checking GetCapabilitySupportedAsync is always false for any known capability.,0
When adding a StatusFilter for Available Xbox is never shown.,0
This makes it very hard to know upfront if the user can actually launch an URI on Xbox - because its totally unclear whether Xbox is currently running or applications are allowed to run remotely.,0
Nevertheless if Xbox is running and I use the RemoteLauncher the app is at least started correctly.,0
The state is always Unknown (when the watcher triggers Added or Updated event).,0
using send to compressed ZIP folder with files > 4GB outputs non-ISO-21320-1:2015-conforming files which results in errors in many unzip softwares including unzip reference implementation from info-zip.org as well as 7zip libarchive libzip and others.,0
From the build 17711 Windows.ApplicationModel.AppService.AppServiceConnection.OpenAsync() consistently returns Unknown Error.,0
Ive tried this sample but not a luck.,0
The unknown error also happens on build 17713 and Im curious is this just a bug or will this feature stop on future windows release?,0
Windows Store Policy for Adult Content:,0
Microsoft support working for Report App are taking down apps which have partial but no nudity.,0
Game of Thrones is on the Windows Store and contains full frontal nudity and graphic  scenes so it is quite ridiculous when apps are removed that have partial nudity or body parts blurred out or covered.,0
Windows Store Policy for Adult Content,0
Partial nudity is not pornographic nor sexually explicit.,0
Note that a Windows Forms implementation probably wont work because of deep-seated incompatibilities in the Windows Forms architecture.,0
A WPF-only solution is enough for me however.,0
It is currently officially impossible to display the acrylic window-background effect in a non-UWP window.,0
With the new Windows UI Library now in pre-release.,0
Are there plans to ensure new controls will be listed in the Toolbox alongside the OS based standard controls?,0
Will dragging from the toolbox automatically add the using markup to the page?,0
Will the Blend features like isolated Template editing be working?,0
Consistency could be ruined if every dev needs to handle manual markup especially as the UI Toolkit iterates in the future.,0
Will the compact mode resource dictionary be bundled with the nuget package so it can be referenced in the app resources without having to ask developers to copy and paste XAML files.,0
Currently the ManipulationDelta event args provides a single scale factor for pinch/stretch events.,0
Its awkward to have different means of resizing objects.,0
Text boxes on the other hand have little handles attached to use for resizing.,0
A DNS-SD service registration does not respond to mDNS queries having a class of ANY but only responds to queries having a class of IN.,0
Do stuff now that the service is registered.,0
I have seen api recording and streaming and previewing the capture from the video.,0
Offcourse the api can throw CommandNotFoundException.,0
Currently it is unavailable in Israel and cant compliment my already installed Office and OneDrive apps,0
CharacterCasing has been added to the platform but it seems to only be used on editable text controls.,0
Today we have the x:DefaultBindMode attribute to define the default binding mode generated for a compiled data binding created with x:Bind.,0
Currently I can assign a license to all members of a group but it isnt kept up to date.,0
I have a bar-code scanner attached to my windows machine USB port.,0
Probably through a direct draw surface(s).,0
Without this information it will not be worthwhile for me to pursue the creation of a virtual reality system and with this information I can get the job done in a few days.,0
There are design toolkits available for several designer programs at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/design/downloads/index.,0
now its readonly,0
Windbg Preview Available for Offline Downloads,0
When typing in the Whats New text area a message Release notes canâ€™t be more than 1500 characters with a red (X) glyph appears when you reach 1458 characters.,0

Yellow exclamation?,0
one keychain( Bluetooth chip inserted in a keychain for Dynamic Lock to pair) included with software purchase and the option to purchase multiple key-chains for each user.,0
Windows 10 64-bit Each window does not have Max/Min buttons at the upper left hand corner for user functionality.,0
10 point touch interface only in some applications gestures not functioning and no exit button to reach local environment.,0
I understand this is an Asus and Microsoft concern and hope this evaluation helps in the next update.,0
At Build 2018 support between Cortana and Alexa was announced.,0
I have built an app that targets Windows 8 and the customer is looking for a servicing fix on Windows 8.,0
I have got the fix ready but in order to produce a fix I need to be able to compile with the Microsoft Advertising SDK for Windows 8 (Xaml).,0
Is there anywhere I can find a copy and download it?,0
I have included code to reproduce the issue:,0
The issue seems to be somewhere in Windows.UI.Xaml.dll!TextBlockViewHelpers::AdjustPositionByCharacterCount().,0
It appears that garbage data (from the stack I assume) is being used for the value `curInlineLength`.,0
Call stack: https://hastebin.com/legulilabu,0
Is not news that Window mobile wont have a chance against the major OSs out in the market so I was thinking why try to implement something new when what is out there can be used for good on Microsoft side?,0
So this I have been thinking so far:,0
Microsoft have a good amount of apps on the Google Play Store.,0
They have a great launcher Cortana Outlook Office for mobile and so on.,0
How many consumers runs W10 on their PCs or laptops?,0
The ApplicationViewMode CompactOverlay (also known as Picture-in-Picture Mini-Mode or Always-on-top) for UWP apps has a maximum window size which seems to be a square with sides of approximately half screen height.,0
Unfortunately I can not since this is limited through Windows.,0
Is there a good reason for this somehow arbitrary limit?,0
Its mini mode has exactly the same limitation.,0
Other than our product manager said 500 pixels are a good maximum width and height for something called compact,0
Previously it was possible to add an EventSetter to the DataGridRows style (As mentioned here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22790181/wpf-datagrid-row-double-click-event-programmatically) but since EventSetter is now not apart of UWP I am left without this functionality.0,0
This already exists with the ListView class which has a similar ItemClicked event as an alternative to SelectionChanged.,0
This can become inefficient and somewhat confusing when users are able to select more than one items.,0
This is helpful for layout debugging.,0
Suppose Windows is misbehaving.,0
Suppose I want this to happen under program control.,0
Suppose I want it to be absolutely certain the video has not been monkeyed with.,0
I can add only a style + behavior or create a custom control for it.,0
What do you prefer?,0
Could someone answer my question please?,0
The Windows Bridge does not create a correct output files.,0
I disabled the AV the result is unsucceesful.,0
What would I do?,0
It looks like the bridge cannot remove its own folder while cleaning up the environment.,0
I made a UWP app with a ListView (using KeepLastItemInView).,0
On many systems (probably the slower ones) the scrolling behavior is very odd.,0
Using the touchpad/mousewheel the scrollbar starts moving but not the contents of the ListView.,0
I need to drag the scrollbar using the mouse to go the bottom/top of the ListView.,0
This behavior is not consistent.,0
On other systems is works as expected.,0
So they get stuck in all the networks devices cache and never go away.,0
I have found other reports of people around the internet who have struggled with the same bug e.g.,0
I filed one against a Microsoft example on Github here:,0
I am using Microsofts DNS-SD which aims to implement the Zeroconf standard RFC 6763. https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6763,0
I got nearly everything working except the case of finding all service types on the network using the service type services.dns-sd.udp on the local domain.,0
This is really useful for making debugging tools such as making a Service Discovery browser.,0
I get no results when I try plugging services.dns-sd.udp.,0
You can see this for the summary on this feature here or in the RFC.,0
For comparison Ive tested this on Bonjour Avahi and Androids Network Service Discovery and they all handle this case correctly.,0
First is there any way to get this to work?,0
Im using the Microsoft example found here:,0
(find all service types) does not work.,0
For comparison Iveâ€¦ more,0
That was a very good build.,0
Template 10 has a Loading (Busy) page that has this functionality.,0
The existing color picker have a very long height.,0
I know this will be simple just edit the style but I cant make it right,0
When dropping appx bundles onto the drop target the page takes a long time to respond.,0
Because the page doesnt change to reflect the drop operation was successful I inadvertently drop multiple packages onto the target wasting my time and bandwidth.,0
As a developer Im always in the Dev Dashboard.,0
Despite being built to appear as a single-page app clicking pretty much any link in Dev Dashboard will result in an entire reload of the page to include navigation bars and columns.,0
This behavior makes quick health checks and submissions nearly impossible.,0
I now avoid logging in until absolutely required.,0
I cant delete or hide them in the dashboard.,0
This eats up screen real estate and impacts load times.,0
I contacted support and they cant delete them either (SRX1418420784ID),0
As a developer that has to stay on top of feedback I receive feedback from users around the world.,0
I cannot delete this feedback.,0
This clutters up my feedback interface and impacts load times.,0
I contacted support and they cant delete it either SRX1428283722ID,0
As a developer I manage customer groups for package flighting and customer segmentation.,0
When Im done using a Customer Group I cannot delete or hide it.,0
Unused groups eat up screen estate and impact load time of the page.,0
As a developer I create submissions for my apps.,0
In the Age Ratings area Im told my Current Rating ID is 4544c68c-6026-433b-be71-e662dd2f88e4.,0
I dont know what that means.,0
I hope its right.,0
This screws up my group metrics (e.g. count) and makes it annoying when sending out email blasts (commercial providers use recipients as a metric for billing).,0
When I click a customer group to manage it opens in a new window unlike most of the other links in the dashboard.,0
This may seem minor but its a huge irritant.,0
Death by a thousand cuts...,0
This data is critical to resolving customer issues.,0
Note you cannot see files/images attached to the item,0
Bonus: You cant delete this feedback.,0
When a machine automatically reboots as part of installing updates any running apps are closed.,0
A small number of non-UWP desktop apps do this but rely on service components to trigger restarting the app which is undesirable in a modern/UWP environment.,0
Im aware that theres some potential overlap here with proposed timeline and sets functionality which allows people to continue where they left off but this request is specifically focused on what happens when the PC restarts without interaction when the user is away from the device.,0
This violates developer expectations.,0
Since the SemanticZoom is subscribed to the BackRequested event if I navigate to another page and press the back button the BackRequested event is not called on my navigated page since it is handled by the SemanticZoom in the previous page even if page caching is disabled for the Frame.,0
Everytime I open a UWP app both Xpadder and the app recognize input thus doubling the signal.,0
Even the hamburger button does not work properly when using extended view and collapsed back button.,0
the hamburger button is on the side of the back button.,0

Getting version and changelog info in Microsoft Store on WIndows 10 is way to hard.,0
I find that its really well hidden sometimes I cant find it at all.,0
Take spotify for instance (https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9ncbcszsjrsb).,0
All I find is initial release date.,0
I want to know what date it was updates what version number it currently has and weather the developer provided a changelog.,0
I have a scenario when my user wants to sign into two different accounts.,0
it logs off account 1 when logging into account 2).,0
API uses a WebView-based auth.,0
There are a lot of ms-settings:*** commands to launch different settings pages from code on HoloLens but there is no way to call the utilities page under the sysem settings.,0
Our primary UWP app is currently compiled as x86 only because there are some limitations of C++ libs we use.,0
Weve discovered just today that WebGL does not work in WebView in UWP apps compiled as x86 on Windows 10 1803.,0
When using MenyFlyout.ShowAt(FrameworkElement Point) with MenuFlyoutPresenter Style with rounded corners or other semitransparency unwanted white background is shown under it in Windows 10 1803.,0
This was not happening before on Windows 10 1709 or earlier.,0
Our app is using MenuFlyout with shadow effect a lot so its causing us lot of headache right now.,0
Mouse sensors and other similar harware devices.,0
For user the sensors are the different places and ways to touch in space having XYZ coordinates like:,0
This is the second question with kind of hardware device is use to.,0
And when you type GlyphUri in the VS XAML Editor and type equal sign it pops up an opinions menu to open a FontIcon Wizard.,0

When running a UWP app on Win 10 desktop Im able to add two TimedTextCues to a TimedMetadataTrack with the same StartTime but on mobile it results in a crash.,0
Im guessing this is a bug because it doesnt produce an understandable exception.,0
If I add the cues to the track before adding the track to mediaSource.ExternalTimedMetadataTracks the crash happens when adding the track.,0

But why was it working on my local machine?,0
This is because I am using Visual Studio 15.7.1 which has already fixed the problem.,0
Unfortunately the build infrastructure of Microsoft which is used for the UWP certification process (at least for our targeted OS version: Windows 10 falls creators update) uses the buggy version of the SupportedAPIs-x?,0
After I used the latest version of PInvoke.Kernel32.dll which contains a workaround for the problem all was fine.,0
Local release builds created with the native toolchain of VS 15.7.1 are working.,0
Here the SupportedAPIs-x?,0

I experienced problem with UWP ListView particularly using ISupportIncrementalLoading interface as a datasource.,0
A few words about problem context:,0
In our UWP app there is a ListView and it uses ISupportIncrementalLoading as a DataSource.,0
And while next part of data is loading ListView is disabled.,0
So the problem in that if you scroll ListView in way you catch ScrollBar and pull it to the down,0
when you scroll to the end of the list ListView will be disabled for some period of time (while data is loading).,0
And if you release mouse button from ScrollBar,0
You cannot hover mouse on ScrollBar because when try to do it ScrollBar goes upper.,0
Note 1: Ive got success with experiencing this problem in UWP app created from scratch (used ListView and ISupportIncrementalLoading).,0
Note 2: if discard of using ISupportIncrementalLoading,0
the problem exists but a bit another kind of.,0
Thanks in advance!,0

We built a UWP application that reads public data off ISO 7816 smart cards successfully until we realized that the app fails to function in release mode.,0

In release mode we generate the appx and it passes windows certification.,0
The smartcard functionality however which is based on a .net standard 2.0 library fails to work (https://github.com/danm-de/pcsc-sharp),0
We are now trying to use the native UWP SmartCard API but its largely useless as we cannot find any methods to construct and transmit APDU which are the basic communication block,0
Hope this issue lands in the priority list of Microsoft.,0
For now we have no option but to re-build the app to a non-Microsoft environment.,0

Now lets say next day the app is opened again.,0
As soon as new stories are downloaded they are added at the from of the ListView not all but say top 10 and rest goes to the disk/cache.,0

We are a dev house that specialises in publishing dedicated Xbox Apps.,0
It used to be that there was a really high standard to get certified on Xbox which was tough to get through but at least the standard of apps was pretty high.,0
Now it seems there is zero standard to be certified to publish an app on Xbox and by default EVERY windows 10 app that is published is published on all devices.,0
It is totally crazy and really counterproductive to building any kind of a vibrant ecosystem.,0
One simple example is there is a PDF database app on the new apps list on XBOX!,0
You cannot use it it cannot access files and it has absolutely no viable function on Xbox One.,0
Yet somehow this passes certification and is thrown on the pile of rubbish that now clutters the new app section.,0
It is hugely frustrating to put months of work into building an app for xbox and stand no chance of getting it downloaded because nobody will ever be able to find it.,0

This limitation is a contribution to a diminished user experience (and developer experience) when compared to these other platforms.,0
This idea is so bad on so many levels.,0

ContentDialog is currently far too difficult to use for two reasons: locking and placement.,0
This means that ContentDialog.ShowAsync will wait until any currently-displayed ContentDialog is dismissed before showing the new dialog.,0
On the other hand if ShowAsync( ContentDialogPlacement.InPlace) is used then (a) it is not convenient because one must separately embed the dialog in XAML and (b) it doesnt always work because an exception occurs if ShowAsync(InPlace) is called on the dialog before the XAML is fully loaded.,0

It can be used between UWP apps but not in Windows Explorer which really is a shame.,0
There are desktop Win32 APIs for delay creation of files that are used heavily e.g.,0
in WinZIP and similar applications to delay actual unzip of files until really required but they cannot be used in UWP.,0
Things like MinConnectionInterval MaxConnectionInterval SlaveLatency and Connection Supervisory Timeout,0
It is a compendium of various PDF viewer tutorials rolled into a single user control.,0
This of course can already be found in WPF any for any developers who want to migrate their classic desktop app to UWP this would be a big boost.,0
actual implementing an selection of file or folder in UWP (how easy but stupid),0
so picker.SuggestedStartLocation is not a string to a path but only a selection of libraries.,0
now after the great Windows 10 Fall Creators Update it is still a joke to switch and develop to UWP.,0
does anybody at MS have an idea how to propose an path in an UWP application?,0
Under UWP it is still not possible to open a folder or file out of the sandbox.,0
and thereby... the folderpicker has no preview to the content in a folder.,0
so this is now in 2017 after the great fall creators update still a ridiculous status of the great iniative: change toâ€¦ more,0
Well currently I have a Uwp app that needs to call a web.api service that is secured with azure ad.,0
I have been looking for samples and tutorials to do this and I have found some.,0
But they all differ in what to do exactly.,0
For example a long running task where the user is not allowed to back out until it completes.,0
Am even stock now  I would be glad if you can update it now.,0
I need a similar feature for UWP.,0
There are several issues with the file activation NeighboringFilesQuery argument and the file system indexer.,0
If files are loaded using the NeighboringFilesQuery then GetPropertiesAsync on those files will only return properties that have been indexed.,0
This prevents reading things like altitude from the GPS location data.,0
The above is made a lot worse on computers where indexing file content is disabled (right click on the drive in Explorer select properties and see check box at the bottom) which used to be recommended for SSD drives.,0
In particular no ImageProperties are available in this case.,0
If the indexer is really broken (for some reason this started happening on my PC so is not uncommon) then it will fail to pick up any neighboring files at all (confirmed by using the default Photos app to open a photo in a folder with lots of photos and it only showed one photo).,0
I dont think this is a security issue because the data is in the file and the file contents are readable.,0
When setting ToolTipService.Placement to Mouse the text in the tooltip is no longer sharp.,0
It looks like the tooltip is not perfectly aligned to the device pixels but rather half a pixel off vertically.,0

I upgraded to the latest VS 2017 and change my UWP app to use .Net.Native 2.0.,0
It now gets a number of linker problems that are being caused by Microsoft components.,0
I dont call this function.,0
When I traced down some new crashes I found that Socket.ConnectAsync is trying to call this function and failing because it doesnt exist.,0
I have about 15-20 similar errors in the build that are referencing things I dont directly call.,0
Ive reverted to .Net.Native 1.7 until this gets fixed.,0
Calling this method would throw exception at runtime.,0
In Windows Forms toolkit there is a handy control called the NumericUpDownControl.,0

3) Build and run the app,0
Keyboard remains NumericPin.,0
10) See that the InputScopes of the TextBoxes are now honored.,0
4) Before doing anything else click the Show touch keyboard button in the notification tray such that the touch keyboard appears.,0
I think I found a problem in Media Player.,0
In this case will be fired only MediaPlayer.PlaybackSession.PlaybackStateChanged event and it is not possible to detect whether app was paused through user or system.,0
But if phone calls then will be simulated SystemMediaTransportControls pause button click (MediaPlayer.SystemMediaTransportControls.ButtonPressed event) and on phone call I can correctly stop my player and change some states.,0
Ive looked into using a SoftwareBitmapSource instead but this is a lot slower and uses more memory and Im not 100% sure whether its Dispose method works (doesnt affect memory shown in VS debugger but did seem to have an effect when testing using a mobile emulator).,0
I am preloading images for speed and I need to release the memory immediately when no longer needed to prevent memory failures but setting the reference to null and even calling GC.Collect() immediately does not always result in an immediate release of memory.,0
Compact overlay window is always shown at the right-top corner.,0

and not calling SetDesiredBounds!,0
This is what the screen looks like: https://1drv.ms/i/s!AqT0PAFUIw04htwcFjitFI7iNTXl5A,0
(sorry for the photo could not do a regular screen shot at the moment!),0
Yes video and transport controls cover the entire media player!,0
In full screen transport controls (not video) do also respect the safe area.,0
Otherwise this looks cut and incomplete.,0
Nevertheless so far this is ok and could be called as expected.,0
The safe area is removed... and it looks like the following: https://1drv.ms/i/s!AqT0PAFUIw04htwdhtSgx38PFkcWeQ,0
Page has no more safe area BUT on the transport controls have suddenly the safe area even though the media player is part WITHIN the page.,0
(For full screen it remains the same framed version as before so no additional screen shot) Why are transport controls no longer covering the entire video?,0
Thats an real issue.,0
I am removing the safe area by calling SetDesiredBounds and I am experiencing framed transport controls then even when using as control somewhere within the page.,0
I debugged this a lot and found a solution (and realized a very dirty hack by Microsoft):,0
In my app I am using custom transport controls and I used the original template as a starting point.,0
This is documented nowhere and has the bad effect described above.,0
Nevertheless I would expect a less hacky solution.,0
And fiddling arround with a grid by name is just a dirty hack since this does not work with custom transport controls as long as the magic grid with its name is not present.,0
But when we play a video file using MediaStreamSource it is not possible to pass through the subtitle streams because we cannot create MediaStreamDescriptors for them.,0
So audio and video works but subtitles dont work.,0
I am unable to use containers and VmWare/VirtualBox on Windows 10 at the same time due to the restriction of Hyper-V.,0

While downloading a file with BackgroundDownloader the progress updates every 1MB which is not really accurate.,0

There are many cases where you have different kind of data and group them by data type.,0
Or you display search results for various item types in one view.,0
But it causes a context switch from native->.net and back for each item which will slow down the control when showing a lot of items (this is noticeable on slow devices or phones).,0
Now the control does not need to call selector for every item speeding up the control.,0
But it causes a context switch from native->.net and back for each item whichâ€¦ more,0

As per https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/projects/events/build/2017/dev-center-analytics-for-win32-developers?playlist=Dev-Center-Store-Services the Dev center has support to monitor Crash reports for native win32 desktop apps without publishing into the store.,0
But I couldnt find any option in my dev center account to support this functionality.,0
However the API was designed that it will introduce severe overhead in the following scenario.,0
These objects are semi-transparent (alpha-blending) so I need to draw them sorted by distance to camera (back to front) and not by state changes.,0
Lets assume I have 50 objects which are Soft Particles (SP),0
And 50 objects that are triangle meshes (TM),0
Both SP and TM use alpha blending.,0
SP dont do depth writes but they do depth-tests and depth reads in the shader.,0
So both SP and TM do legal operations (they dont write to the depth buffer and read in the shader at the same time),0
However in the worst case when SP and TM are ordered in the following way:,0
To my understanding OMSetRenderTargets is a slow operation but I need to call it 100 times.,0
That way would be very beneficial:,0
I dont need to call OMSetRenderTargets for each draw call where I want to change D3D11DSVREADONLYDEPTH.,0
Say I have 100 objects to draw.,0
SP dont do depth writes but they do depth-testsâ€¦ more,0

Before recent changes we were (ab)using the .Reset event type to inform the UI components that the collection has changed.,0
In the current version we have optimized the collection so it knows *exactly* what has changed in the suspension state.,0
We will only invoke the correct Add / Remove actions for all the items.,0
Unfortunately it looks like the UI components (in this case a ListBox) cannot deal with the .Add and *multiple items*.,0
The event args implementation correctly contains all the added items and the right indexes (all covered by unit tests).,0
For some notes on the investigation see https://github.com/Catel/Catel/issues/1066,0

In 99 percent of cases I receive MeasureOverride exception or Error HRESULT EFAIL has been returned from a call to a COM component.. No matter what the problem is youll get that kind of useless information.,0
Which means that something went wrong.,0
No stacktrace and guess yourself is what WinRT development looks like.,0
Even the official Microsoft UWP sample accuses the same problem:,0
For large teams just having one team member being able to do this is a bad design decision.,0
The API is fine but where Im running into trouble is that things like Flyouts and Dialogs intercept any and all access to the event.,0

This makes for problems with things like:,0

Its not possible to set the Hijri adjustment for the month of Ramadan/Shaban though which can vary per region/user (some users like to use the adjustment of a different country).,0
The Windows 10 Calender app show cases this feature with their calender when you set the alternative calender to Hijri a new setting shows up which is Hijri adjustment and it works nice.,0

ApplicationView.SuppressSystemOverlays has been deprecated for a while and the warning message says use TryEnterFullScreenMode instead.,0
However theres an important difference in behavior that has prevented is from switching.,0
When you use full screen mode StatusBar.ShowAsync doesnt work.,0
To give you some context why this matters to us our app is a video streaming app with both VoD and live TV content.,0
When the user starts video playback on a phone we use SuppressSystemOverlays to hide the navigation bar (on devices such as Lumia 950 that has them) and status bar.,0
But we turn the status bar back to visible along with other playback controls when the user taps the screen.,0
The information in the status bar is highly relevant to a video app.,0
Sure we could replace the status bar with our own UI containing the same info.,0

Video overlay support for example picture in picture,0
Native support of SVG animation with SMIL inside XAML for Beautiful and Responsive UI and Hardware acceleration backend on OpenGL/Direct3D/Vulkan/Metal.,0
The advantage of XAML to natively support SVG with SMIL is that you as a developer would not have to worry about these icons and animations the design or animator could do that in other software and deliver SVGs to you.,0
In addition to being able to search on the internet SVG animated icons ready to use.,0
These are widely used in the real world today.,0
In several areas we find these types of control such as audio/video playes visual programming animation software single/multitracks audio editors video editors slide editors photo gallery websites social networks among many others.,0
The Backgroundtasks can currently be launched every 15 minutes by the TimeTrigger.,0
Unfortunately if a task is launched via this TimeTrigger but appears idle to the Operating System then it is SUSPENDED.,0
This means the task can not execute for the full 15 minute window.,0
My current Backgroundtask has a timer in it which would allow my background task to wake up on a timer event periodically do some processing then wait again.,0
This low amount of processing looks to be Idle so gets suspended.,0
If you either leave Idle tasks alone (they are Idle so not using system resources right?,0
I like the way MSPoweruser app has implemented this feature.,0
In that app If we click Continue Reading button it will show all the devices connected to this device.,0
So if I click on a device it will open the app on that device with the same artice.,0
The Street and StreetNumber property of the MapLocationFinder.FindLocationsAsync() results have no value.,0
However street and house number are included correctly in the FormattedAddress property.,0
This bug occurs sine the Creators Update.,0

What if Microsoft adds ARM64 target tomorrow?,0
I handle rendering the entire interface with my own commands using DirectX rendering.,0
This works briliantly with just few lines of code.,0

I am especially interested in how this would work for my app to span different hardware types regardless of form factor or OS -- the idea of a seamless experience between Windows desktop and Android or iOS mobile is compelling... but I need to see some examples before I invest.,0
Ive read about Project Rome and the possibility of creating cross-device experiences (https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2016/10/11/cross-device-experience-with-project-rome/) and am particularly interested in the Project Rome Android SDK (https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2017/02/08/announcing-project-rome-android-sdk/#HQl7ibqTUGYzrufw.97).,0
a) It is extremely slow.,0
b) It draws MapPolygons blurred with jagged borders.,0
c) It draws MapPolylines in wrong positions (very very often).,0
They take right position then after manual shifting of map but initially 20-30% of them are misplaced after being added to MapElements collection.,0
Most often it occurs near map borders.,0
The SDK itself support the side-by-side installation then we can try the new API with our UWP Apps.,0
But there are no way to distribute this kind of app to testers or customers that use Win10 Insider preview.,0
It only allow the Customer Update SDK level.,0
You know many of Microsoft Apps are updated with new SDK and itll be available at the store during Insider Preview.,0
For example MS provide the lot of sdk and new technologies about Win10 Fall CU.,0
This is really a must for apps that target businesses or wish/must to support older devices that will not get the latest versions.,0

It appears that the MapIcon rendering by the MapControl has changed significantly with the Windows 10 Creators update.,0
We have an app that at times adds hundreds of MapIcon objects to the MapControl.,0
Before Creators update this worked fine and the vast majority if not all were displayed.,0
After creators update we are only seeing a small portion of the MapIcon objects being rendered onto the map.,0
And its not because they are colliding with other MapIcons.,0
We are seeing large portions of the map not displaying any of the MapIcons weve added.,0
We have always been aware of the guidance that a MapIcon is not guaranteed to be displayed but its never been a problem.,0
Weve even tried setting MapElementCollisionBehavior.RemainVisible but it doesnt make much difference.,0
It seems like theres now some sort of internal limit on how many MapIcons are displayed at a time.,0
I couldnt find anything in the release notes about this change.,0
Is this change in behavior expected or a bug?,0
The UWP scrollbar is white and is invisible on a light background.,0

As a result skeletal tracking apps do not work on the XBOX platform.,0
The UWP application platform has a rich media API which allows querying of a video device (e.g.,0

Ive noticed that when you create a DataPackage containing both data provided directly (lets say text using SetData) and delayed formats like a bitmap (using SetDataProvider) when closing the application the whole clipboard content is cleared.,0
In VS2015 (and maybe in 2017) the compiler raised a warning (that we missed) that stated some of our code was currently unsupported by the UWP toolchain.,0

Currently MultiSelectModel does not work as documented:,0
Player: Your app is activated one time.,0
All of the selected files are passed to your app as argument parameters.,0
As far as Anniversary Update and Creators Update are concerned MultiSelectModel has no effect and only one file is passed as argument to the application regardless of how many files have been selected in Explorer.,0
Please support the passing of all selected files as command arguments.,0
All the documentation on how to call UWP methods are in C# and require the .NET platform.,0

This enumeration is mainly used with AppBarButton like as <AppBarButton Icon=Smile/>.,0
Recent Segoe MDL2 asset have many of new glyphs.,0
But the enumeration of Symbol is not updated from Win10 10240.,0
And some of important glyphs of 10240 are also lacked from the enumeration.,0
For example Share glyph - 0xE72D - is not enumerated.,0
But many of developers dont.,0
(Like Photo app),0
This cause the many of engineers use the bitmap or other similar glyphs.,0
This is still happening - Ive tested it myself now after the update to 10.0.14393.953.,0
My users are also reporting the same problem and some of them say they resign of the app/platform (!),0
and I must say that I completely understand them.,0
How we the developers are supposed to work when such important thing like access to files is not working after the OS update.,0
This affects many of the apps and in result the whole platform.,0
The FutureAccessList has an issue.,0
After a firmware update for my phone I was unable to retrieve folders/files from a token.,0

Currently the only way to set BackgroundDownloaders header is by SetHeader method unfortunately once you set the heder value you cannot clear it as the method:,0
This method can be called multiple times for the same header.,0
The values will then be concatenated.,0
The problem comes when we want to create multiple downloads with one downloader if the server requires to send request via headers we are not able to downloaded files/items within one downloader every item requires to create a new downloader instance with new headers.,0
Of course in that case we cannot use grouped toast notification.,0

Currently it is possible to specify multiple groups/subgroups within the various tile sizes for adaptive tiles but if the content doesnt fit then some groups wont necessarily ever be shown (they are dropped since the tile cant fit the groups).,0
I recently browsed the UWP docs and found some interesting APIs about Accessory Management etc.,0
For me it is perfectly acceptable to request access to them so they are still under control but I do not want to create a company account for this.,0
Without APIs you are losing customers to Android/iOS as many people would love to have apps which can control their volume system theme etc.,0
Current steps are outlined here:,0
Since I developed an application which could massively profit from those APIs as they allow volume control etc I wanted to use them.,0
Unfortunately for me I cannot use those APIs as they are restricted for use and getting access is only possible with a company developer account which I do not have.,0
For me it is perfectly acceptable to request access to them so they are still under control but I do not want to createâ€¦ more,0

On both the mobile and desktop versions of the Store app you can browse these categories.,0
However this feature is not present in the Store app on the Xbox.,0
Unless your app makes it into the Top Apps sections or Promoted apps then users can only download your app if they know about it and search for it by name themselves.,0
If their app like mine is published solely to the Xbox then it makes it very hard for users to become aware of your app.,0
When you publish an app in Dev Center it allows you to select the category (and subcategory) for the app to be placed into.,0
If their app like mine is published solely to the Xbox then it makes itâ€¦ more,0
The combination of toasts and Action Center provide a convenient lightweight way to communication with users but after notifications are read they disappear.,0
Im currently working on a clock control for my UWP todo-list app 2Day (www.2day-app.com).,0
Im creating this control using inspiration from the great Material Design WPF toolkit.,0
The very early work in progress version is available on my repo: https://github.com/japf/uwp-material-clock,0
In UWP we have a CommandBar but it seems its not easy to use to build a classic toolbar for a desktop application.,0
But as this is such a central control it should be part of the platform.,0
Youre building on a TreeView-control as your backlog on https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/platform shows.,0
Im using the TreeView of your official samples on https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/tree/dev/Samples/XamlTreeView.,0
The point that I really miss when working with hierarchical data is the HierarchicalDataTemplate like we have it today in WPF.,0
It makes especially sense when you release a control for hierarchical data like the TreeView.,0
1000 entries as limit for FutureAccessList is way to low.,0
Best practice until now:,0
Store the folder containing the file wont exceed the limit as fast as storing each file in the FutureAccessList.,0
One Exception where a folder cant be added:,0
A big downside hides in DragDrop (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/app-to-app/drag-and-drop),0
To counter that and trying to add the folder from the file this wont be possible because an exception would be thrown even if you added the file itself to the FutureAccessList before that.,0
Example (trying to add folder from dragDrop Filetarget to FutureAccessList):,0
 // Were not able to add this folder,0

Similar request but a report control for rdlc support:,0
Currently it is nearly impossible to create a custom virtualizing panel.,0
But in UWP it is impossible because the base classes have private constructors and the other classes are sealed.,0
A lot of custom controls do not use virtualization because it is so hard to implement in UWP.,0
This makes the controls hard or even impossible to use with large collections.,0

APIs is messy and not appropriate for loading scale sensitive assets.,0
Parsing the PRI is only possible in unencrypted appx scenarios.,0

There are genuine use cases when we need to keep an app running when close button is pressed.,0
You can only allow an app to catch close button event and minimise it to task bar programatically.,0
Currently I have to save a MP3 stream to a file and then read from the file and transmit it over TCP.,0

However once a user launch the main app ui and close it appservice is also terminated (because both shared same process).,0
This control is not to be confused with the existing pivot viewer in UWP.,0
This control makes a great addition for displaying large amounts of data in a visual friendly format.,0
The control is the equivalent of a pivot table in excel  you simply add the datasets with labels and the control sorts out all the selection fields  visualizations and animations.,0
This was the original microsoft link for the pivot control in Silverlight :,0

So one of two options would be useful:,0
Right now to show something on lock screen we have text and icon notifications at the bottom.,0
There is no way to implement complex text markup rendering without Direct2D or slow manual composition inside Canvas control.,0
There is absolutely no easy way to implement selectable text with complex markup.,0
RichEditBox control exists but there is no lightweight control for just display rich text (RichTextBlock isnt related to RichEditBox and feature-lame).,0
The ToastNotification object has a convenient ExpirationTime property that automatically dismisses it after a given period.,0
Unfortunately the ScheduledToastNotification which is just a ToastNotofcation but scheduled lacks this helping feature.,0
This makes me as a developer scracth my head and write a lot of code including background tasks just so I circumvent this problem and not have the users of my app get crowded with not-so-relevant-anymore notifications in their action center.,0
The MapControl is quite limited in operations with custom tiles.,0
I have need to redraw the tiles periodically because they become outdated (the closest similar example is traffic layer which needs to be periodically refreshed).,0
Even more since this operation results in tiles flickering (because of redraw) I have to use 3 tile sources switching between them.,0
That crasy staff involves heavy redrawing of the map and it also leads to visble scrolling slowing down in the moment of MapTileSource adding (which would be nice to fix too).,0
The (ugly) workaround I use is adding and removing MapTileSource which forces tiles redraw.,0
Currently UWP apps have no ability to include menu controls with excellent mouse support.,0
One click to close the first menu and a second click to open the new one.,0
At the moment there is no possibility to quickly navigate through long lists on small screens.,0
But sometimes lists are not in alphabetic order or there are still thousands of entries starting with the same letter.,0
I donâ€™t know what the component should look like.,0
If the list is alphabetic there is at least the possibility to jump to the first entry with the same first letter.,0
I want to test my apps in multiple languages without changing the region of my entire device.,0
Im developing a Windows Universal App and Im sicked and tired of finding a way to implement encrypted local DB support.,0
(I already have a database file encrypted by SQL Cipher and I just have to read the records),0
But SQLCipher is not - it supports only commercial edition ($899) and I cant afford the expense.,0
Surprisingly NO ONE OF THEM supports Universal App implementation.,0
Thats ridiculous and Im sick and tired of finding the way.,0
Does Microsoft really NOT support local database in developing Universal App?,0
I cant understand why Im confused in this situation which is possible on Android or iOS so easy.,0
I know SQLite support Universal App Development through Nuget in VS2015,0
Thats ridiculous and Im sick and tiredâ€¦ more,0
Basic scenario is the need to store set of secret API keys for various 3-rd party APIs (twitter for example).,0
Just to hardcode API keys inside app executable files is security risk as it can be reverse engeneered.,0
Hello there is currently a bug withing the insider preview for desktop and phone.,0
Mouse scrolling works fine and it was also tested on the normal Windows builds where it was working as intended.,0
And I created this thread on the MSDN forum where it was confirmed that this is an insider preview bug: https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/windowsapps/en-US/af38910b-e097-484a-a76a-94fb7880da6b/uwpwinjslistview-items-cannot-be-invoked-after-scrolling-the-listview-with-the-touchscreen?forum=wpdevelop,0

At least one of the animated GIFs will disappear.,0
Eventually they all disappeared for me.,0
This facility exist for public store apps but not LOB ones.,0
I find myself writing this control over and over in various projects and its never vey good.,0

It also creates a large hurdle for new users and causes a number of headaches.,0
The issue is that our software uses ui access to emulate an onscreen touchpad and custom gestures.,0
We also allow for simultaneous pen and touch to add touch keyboard hotkeys to a docked custom keyboard (typically aids in drawing and ink based applications),0

Currently SmartCard API doesnt have any method to force a reader to reset smartcard (Cold Reset or Warm Reset as described in ISO7816-3).,0

I have two versions of my app: one for Windows Phone 8.1 (v1.x.x.x) and another one for Windows 10 Mobile (v2.x.x.x).,0
Latter uses new features of Windows 10 and receives excellent reviews but store mixes them with worse ratings from Windows Phone 8.1 users.,0
My app users are reporting that they cant get information about my durable add-on on the Xbox One and Xbox One S.,0
When my code checks for the property AddOnLicenses the collection is empty for users that have purchased the add-on.,0
We have tried with ExtendedJsonData property but the add-on array is empty too.,0
We cant determine if the add-on is active and neither the expiration date.,0
 When user invoke the access key of a button to navigate out the AccessKeyDisplayDismissed event of the command bar button isnt invoked.,0
 When the user pressed the access key of a button to navigate out the tooltips of command bar buttons stay where they are.,0

We have a uwp in the store and a desktop companion app.,0
Currently to install our software (and have it function) both programs are needed.,0
The issue we run into is that our desktop app uses ui access.,0
Is ui access support on the list of upcoming features?,0
Having a good informed answer to this question will help tremendously in helping us understand how to proceed.,0
I would be beyond excited to get a response.,0
It would mean the world to our small team to hear from you all!,0
Some of our ui access features may be convertible to direct ink functionality would that be a worthwhile pursuit or would that leave us facing the same intersection from a different direction?,0
our app is called tablet pro it may be of use to know that.,0
Building our email list has been at the forefront of our small software companies goals for a few years.,0
Probably the biggest question I have is how to use the store without loosing our ability to acquire user emails without complicating the process for the end user.,0
I may simply be unaware of how this is done.,0
This would be HUGE.,0
We like a number of the benefits the store offers but it seems without a way to build an list of our clients independent of Microsoft (or anyone but us for that matter) is KEY.,0
Is there a process in place for gaining downloaders email addresses?,0
Since 2009 the advent of Silverlight PivotViewer Control shifted the handling of large datasets giving a way of filtering and analyzing large volumes of data.,0
For line of business applications processing large datasets.,0
Currently the ScrollViewers content can be overpanned.,0
Support the last version of Net Standard 1.6.,0
Developing desktop apps for UWP is subpar as many API are not present like SqlClient.,0
The store does not allow a developer to update their response to a users review once it is made public while users are allowed to update their reviews at will.,0
A user may change his review completely and the original response could become totally irrelevant.,0
I am attempting to design something to support functionality similar to Androids startActivityForResult() using the page stacks but I have no visibility into the management of the page stacks (BackStack and ForwardStack).,0
This introduces the opportunity for a memory leak as these stacks are pruned in response to user navigations.,0
WinRT information: The maximum number (1000) of items in the access list has been reached.,0
This supports the use case for providing a detail view for both the underlying item represented by the Group Header Template as well as that of the represented by the ItemTemplate.,0
Currently I am prohibited from extending and overridding various methods (in my case those concerning Navigation).,0
As a long time WP7/8 and now W10M user I noticed inconsistent behavior of opening flyout with touch versus mouse.,0
Instead in W10M it opens just when I release the finger.,0
This is very annoying as I never know if there is some additional menu under the item or not.,0
Context menu appears while my finger is still touching the screen.,0
But when using touch gesture I would expect behavior known from WP7/8 - flyout (aka context menu) should open after couple miliseconds while my finger is still touching the given item.,0
I use IMFSourceReader on UWP and noticed following bug with FLAC decoding: it will not change position if SetCurrentPosition will be called right after initialization.,0
It is working correct with .mp3 and other codecs but not with FLAC.,0
This would allow apps to say they were listening to KEXP instead only 93.1 and the station information as well.,0
With Silverlight in Windows Phone i had the ability to use FM radio APIs.,0
In UWP I cannot use these APIs as they werent brought over.,0
from an accessory device (like a smartwatch) possible.,0
Our desktop application provides users with custom contact data that wed like to sync for them with Windows 10 contacts.,0
We are working on the Converted version of the app to enable such capabilities and to distribute our desktop app via the Windows Store but we have to distribute it for previous versions of Windows as well and so we cant afford having two completely different versions of the product for the time being.,0
Why do you always have to make a developers life difficult.,0
Theres no easy way to detect Left Control key pushes.,0
Because on international keyboards if Right Alt is pressed then Left Control is also pressed?,0
Why oh why this is the stupidest thing ever.,0
But that doesnt work too because now it turns out that if I press just RightAlt then I can get callbacks for LeftCtrl and RightAlt happening in different frames.,0
OnKeyDown with LeftCtrl gets called in frame 10,0
OnKeyDown with RightAlt gets called in frame 11,0
Waiting for reply.,0
So Ive developed a work around to detect key pushes for LeftCtrl and RightAlt and if both are pressed at the same time then LeftCtrl pushes are ignored.,0
I want my user to stay inside my app.,0
Im using the result of MidiOutPort::GetDeviceSelector() for the device selector string.,0
The DeviceInformation for some of the virtual software ports on the system are returning with generic device names.,0

Currently any UWP developer is forced to use C++ for accessing DirectX features or rely on third party support like SharpDX or Unity3D for those features.,0
Currently a control will not be able to handle the request if the event has already been subscribed to in order to handle navigation.,0
This gave the MasterDetailsView the time it needed to subscribe to the event first in order to handle it.,0
In other projects/frameworks like Template 10 this is not as easily handled because those frameworks have a navigation service that subscribes to the BackRequested event first.,0
The only work around I found for the sample app was to unsubscribe from the event in the shell when the frame has navigated and then subscribe to the event again in theâ€¦ more,0

Hello All,0
This would mimic the Android capability that already exists for its Navigation drawer.,0
I have actually implemented this in one of my apps so you can see it in action.,0
It is in an app called Drudge Live (https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9wzdncrdm04m) and in the app the swipe-open capability is only enabled on phones.,0
Based on feedback I have received the capability is very important because it allows the use and opening of hamburger menus on phones using one hand.,0
I was previously getting a lot of grief over the switch to a hamburger menu by phone users but this gives them back the ability to navigate with one hand on the phone.,0
However there seems to be no such accommodation for style definitions located either in ResourceDictionary files or embedded directly into the page XAML.,0
In code there is a way to detect and work with features that are in newer Windows 10 builds (using ApiInformation) so that code can use new features while gracefully degrading on older builds.,0
If you have a style that uses a new property or enumeration value anyone opening the app in an older Win 10 build will immediately crash.,0
Its a lot easier to build a following when its free.,0
Keeping this in mind was thinking of making some of my products donationware.,0
The ability for an end user to donate allows me to make the app free.,0
Support for developers willing to get the apps converted and placed in the Windows store is below anecdotal.,0
Like thousands of other developers I have tried for now over a month to convert my app and followed every literatureput up by Microsoft but am still stuck with dependencies.,0

This causes us to treat the windows platform as a special case while APNS / GCM provide a single cohesive story.,0

Currently the xaml engine of UWP does not manage complex control attributes since it does not take System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter into account.,0
That is why we can not write this simple xaml user code:,0
By the way that will be a lot simpler than the WPFs TypeConverter.,0
After having tried TypeConverter on UWP I tried to add implicit operators (casts) to the complex type (Position here) from and to string but xaml does not take them into account.,0

Once you create a CoreIndependentInputSource touch visual feedback is visible again.,0
Even if you disabled it using,0
Its not about aesthetics Visualfeedback kills performance the framerate in games drops by half which is ironic if you think thats the kind of apps CoreIndependentInputSource was created for in the first place.,0
CoreIndependentInputSource has its own Dispatcher does that mean it has its own HWND/message queue?,0
Maybe thats the cause of the bug PointerVisualizationSettings.GetForCurrentView() is tied to the main Window.,0
I got the hWnd from CoreIndependentInputSource.Dispacher using the VS debug inspector and then called TryDisableWindowsVisualFeedback() as seen here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27550373/disable-touch-visual-feedback-on-windows-8-1-programmatically-desktop-app,0

HTTP.sys serves as the kernel component backing IIS and the .NET HttpListener.,0
There are a number of failure cases such as a high incoming request rate filling the request queue that can result in the module rejecting incoming requests directly without handing them off to callers higher on the stack.,0
Information about these failed requests is currently only visible via the HTTPERR log file and a few Perf counters.,0
Neither is ideal.,0
The log file is system-wide requires admin access and lacks any information about what request queue the error is associated with.,0
As such it plays a critical role as the first system to process each incoming HTTP request but it is unfortunately lacking in diagnostics.,0
This leaves the application unaware that it it experiencing such problems.,0

When initiating a chat session the page asks you to let the operator know what the issue is and provides a virtually limitless text field.,0
There is no indication that the text field will only transmit the first 38 characters to the support technician but that apparently is the limit.,0
This ends up further frustrating an already distressed developer and making the job that much harder for the support operator needlessly.,0
This leads the user to have to type AGAIN the whole description.,0
The name reservation field doesnt accept spaces.,0
loopMIDI is also an example of this in the MIDI realm allowing on-the-fly creation/destruction/renaming of virtual MIDI ports although lacking the routing/filtering layer which MIDI-OXs (primitive GUI) routing+filtering is a good example of.,0

I want to thank Lancelot for taking the time to communicate quickly with me.,0
have an exporter for a Adobe XD file that could translate to XAML.,1
and it would be great to have a signed version DXGIFORMATR10G10B10A2SNORM,1
Add support to allow WCF services to be consumed that have custom username/password authentication on the binding.,1
I believe that everyone in XAML lovers we want a robust and complete standard and that facilitates the life of the developer so I propose to include these controls as a standard of XAML specification.,1
or allow 10 minute or maybe even 5 minute TimeTriggers to be used.,1
I would like from the device portal the ability to reset the device.,1
Create a control for Continue in different device Like Continue Reading etc.,1
So it would be nice to create controls to achieve Microsofts vision easily.,1
I would like my apps be automatically supported on any new processor architectures.,1
Please add simple API:,1
The application XBOX DEV MODE COMPANION should have an option to make it a VR.,1
Make it something unique windows phone attracting more customers.,1
Have a separate Class Library that only supports new SDK versions and it will only be loaded into the app on newer SDK versions therefore you can write safe XAML markup including new Controls and Properties.,1
Alternatively it would be nice if the UWP platform was updated separately from Windows so apps would be able to support all the new Controls/Styles.,1
There needs to be a way to define new XAML Controls/Properties/Etc. as currently if you want to add these with a lower Minimum version it has to be from code-behind.,1
I would like to try this out -- making my app an experience shared across multiple close proximity devices but it would be very helpful to see some code samples.,1
There should be alternative condensed and aligned with Win32 style of controls that we can use to create applications that are looking just like their classical counterparts while benefitting from UWP improvements.,1
I belive that Store should control the SDK level more grained.,1
Please add background to TextBlock control.,1
Please integrate ffmpeg or vlc libraries by default in these xaml elements to make it easier for developers to build apps that run all kinds of video and audio files.,1
It would be nice to be able to assign a (compiled) binding to properties through the VisualState Setters of XamlBehaviors.,1
Please add a delegate version for the PropertyMetadata.Create where the DependencyProperty is supplied so you can create a default value for the dependency object instead of a simple default value.,1
Please bring all languages to Cortana for IoT because are needed to create devices for interacting people from around the world.,1
Provide semantic animations like fadeIn fadeout Crossfade etc.,1
Should also do this for other converters for same behavior.,1
If white background scrollbar should be a different color so it is fully visible,1
It could be really good to hot reload the app when changing C# or XAML code.,1
It would be great to add a property to choose the direction of the progress bar clockwise or counterclockwise.,1
When notifications are removed from one device they should be removed from all devices by default.,1
I know there are no plans for running UWP apps in Windows 7 but a designer would be nice and would virtually remove the need to upgrade to Windows 10 before writing apps for it.,1
Aside from my personal dilemma of a missing device it would definitely make sense to be able testing code in an emulator first instead of having lots of hardware around all the time.,1
If Microsoft fears somebody could use the emulator for playing games on a PC then just turn off games.,1
Please create ActualStartLocation in FileOpenPicker so that we can open the file selection dialog into the exact folder we want.,1
Please add an API that allows to read the temperature from the device (e.g.,1
Please add the ability to access the rendering pipeline to the MapControl class.,1
It would be great if the <Application Executable=launcher.exe> element or the <uap3:Extension Category=windows.appExecutionAlias> element would allow me to specify arguments in the AppxManifest.xml file.,1
So why not include EnablePullToRefresh as a property of MasterDetailsView.,1
It would make developers life much easier if they had a possibility to access files simpler.,1
So my opinion is to create two new controls.,1
One is TextCanvas for Display and Editing both Text and Inking.,1
It would be great if the Roaming Folder Quota was larger than 100KB (1 MB at least) this would prevent us from having to depend on a network/paid service to have great cross-device customer experiences.,1
This is not really completely UWP related but Microsoft should provide free virtual machines of all Windows 10 versions for testing purposes as in my experience UWP is really fragile and could make my app behave differently in every version.,1
Do you think that you could make the Windows Store and other built-in-apps accessible from the device portal making it a lot easier to install new apps that are already on the store and make changes in settings etc.,1
It would be great if something similar to DependencyObject.SetCurrentValue method from WPF would be introduced in the future so that a DependencyProperty can be set to a new value without missing an one-way binding.,1
Can you please expose the Viseme events for the windows speech sythesis.,1
I think it would be useful to have in the toolkit.,1
it would be great to be able to bind / invoke scripts inside a WebView from a ViewModel (like binding a URL to a Property).,1
Symbol Enum should be updated with latest Segoe MDL2 asset collections.,1
If the enumeration are updated with the latest MDL2 glyphs it may helps many of developers who search the correct glyphs.,1
After releasing to refresh the list should animate back to top (as a simple list do) and while awaitng for the data to be fetched the Refresh indicator content should be visible or have a property to control its visibility (i would prefer this one),1
It would be even better if I could have an API that could make the calculations for me and offer up a packet failure/retransmission percent or average time between send and acknowledgment.,1
Optionally the worker side of async / awaitable should accept notification URI in conjunction with Type which ( the Type itself ) may or may not exist on the target of execution in which case it can decide to create exception instance or return typical HTTP message... the important part is the contract of return notification should be extended to the application developer in a way that allows to harvest its result in an expected format potentially by polling yet another resource.,1
But either way please do make an API available.,1
Providing thos apps would boost UWp as platform and thus create more possibilities for Users and Developers together.,1
Please allow private developers to access those capabilities.,1
I hope everyone can publish fonts on the store,1
It would be good for developers to specify auto renewal of the durable paid add-ons in Developer portal so users do not need to repurchase the add-on again and again.,1
A toolbar stacks items from left-to-right and it would be great to have such a toolbar in UWP like we have it today in WPF and several other desktop programming models,1
If you build it it would be great if you could add configurable close-functionality to the tab-header that is bindable to a ViewModel.,1
 ** I think this could be made simpler by support for example a HeaderStyle-Property on the Pivot,1
Maybe the dev should be able to define the panel used for the headers.,1
For a classic desktop application we need a TabControl.,1
So I suggest that you bring the HierarchicalDataTemplate to UWP.,1
Please increase the limit way up or remove it completley.,1
If you add files from across the filesytem which I do in my app... letting the user drop in images and videos from any location you could rapidly hit the 1000 files limit.,1
Increase FutureAccessList limit (like in millions),1
Introduce Userchoice Dialog if AccessException is raised.,1
Also as a secondary request... let FolderPicker.SuggestedStartLocation also be a FolderRelativeId,1
Optional show an user input dialog requesting access to the file or folder and let the user decide.,1
Please add a trigger to start a background task when a nearby NFC tag is recognized.,1
It would be more convenient for the user if my app could react on the NFC tag even when the phone is locked.,1
Add system tray support so that app can be minimised to system tray.,1
You need to provide CoreWindow.Minimise() api in this case.,1
Allow other formats than PCM and float for a FrameOutputNode created with CreateFrameOutputNode of class AudioGraph.,1
This burden would be eliminated would MP3 Frames be available by the FrameOutputNode.,1
Other Formats like MP3 or OGG would be nice.,1
It must be possible to only unload Main UI out of the process without terminating the app service.,1
Allow changing of volume in the Windows Device Portal.,1
Please add the old Silverlight Pivot Control to UWP toolkit.,1
Can you please add an IAP which would have a recurring payment (automatically charge user monthly / annually / etc)?,1
I would like to add a function that automatically loads the lyrics to the song that is played right now.,1
To solve that it would be enough to have read access to the System Media Transport Controls data of other apps.,1
It could be interesting to provide a control to generate and show a Power BI chart inside a UWP application easily with a Control or by code.,1
It would be useful for creating more user-friendly battery related apps that provide better experience for example by refreshing tile or sending notification on the event not some time after it happened.,1
We can also change lock screen background.,1
However it would be useful to get more flexibility.,1
If we could put some templated (or custom) notifications it would save us a lot of work and make lock screen more user friendly.,1
Provide more rich API for text rendering without need to use low-level Direct2D for rich text rendering capabilities.,1
Id also be happy if MapTileSource property changes (like Bounds) were applied to the map without need to remove the tile source and add it back (this is how it can be done currently).,1
(Compare the UI usage with Google Chrome for example.),1
Maybe by default the way it looks now but it should have a slider that is magnified if the user taps close to edge of the list and signals its intention to useâ€¦ more,1
There is should be a way to include secure data (as strings or byte[]) remotely at dev center as app setting.,1
There is should be way to revoke secure data on server which would require re-publishing app with new set of keys and app with revoked keys should fail on access to secure storage.,1
This data should be accessible from secure key storage immediately after app install and keys should be installed into secure key storage as part of app installation process.,1
Provide ability to deploy an update to certain users only.,1
It would really be great if there was a control which allows to move forward an backward like the Microsoft Edge Browser does with touch input or touchpad input.,1
It should work like a horizontal ListView or GridView...so you can normally scroll through the listed items but when you hit the end of the list and continue scrolling the edge-like part should kick in and navigate you to new or old View/Page/List.,1
Id love a control that would be a sibling to ListView or GridView only it was backed by a 2D Canvas instead of an ItemsStackPanel.,1
* Allow the placement of rectangular items in 2D,1
(An optional bonus would be to allow the user to rotate the items.),1
The look and content of the items should of course be customizable.,1
It would be extremely helpful to be able to create MediaSourceStreams for audio streams in the Vorbis and/or Opus formats.,1
DockPanel should be ported to Windows XAML.,1
Currently store access from windows is either enabled or disabled this really needs to be more granular i.e.,1
Should be clear nullable properties in XAML should be supported and not give the error Cannot assign to nullable type on property.,1
Please check and fix this bug as it is causing frustration to Xbox users.,1
For me personally it would be much more convenient to be able to enter my privacy policy content directly into a text field when submitting/updating my app rather than having to provide a URL so I think this should be an option.,1
Allow us to use runtime arguments for Windows.ApplicationModel.FullTrustProcessLauncher.LaunchFullTrustProcessForCurrentAppAsync() in addition to the parameters declared in the manifest,1
In short you could add something like this in your manifest-file:,1
In my case I would also be happy if it was possible to add verbs on all file types but this is something I could live without :).,1
Merging them into a single installer would benefit our users greatly.,1
It seems in order to do that we need to either pull out of the store or convert our desktop app to a uwp and merge the two installers.,1
It would be great if we have an option in disabling the overpanning behavior in ScrollViewer with an API or with any other option to disable it.,1
Net standard should be used by UWP and not limited by it.,1
Because only simple values are supposed to be used as navigation parameters this suggests that a third-party software component must exist for managing the sharing of complex objects between pages.,1
Evidently this is a limitation of the MediaComposition.SaveAsync() API - it should be fixed.,1
If FM radio APIs are brought in it would be amazing if we could get RDS support as well.,1
I believe this should be a user based permission API in case the user doesnt want me to have this ability.,1
I would greatly apperciate if these APIs could be added to UWP.,1
Itd be fantastic if it could be possible to access such data from the converted classic apps.,1
If my app is currently playing audio it would be nice if my app could control the experience and interact how i would want it to outside of the system experience.,1
I would like to control have my app control the vibration/haptic feedback setting.,1
just imagine connecting your phone to a display device and building UWP apps on it it can be the next big thing for developers because no developer wants to carry a 2.5kg laptop wherever he goes...,1
It would be cool to have a option to remove the border and caption of the window so we can make non rectangular windows just like with GDI+ and the Layered Windows API,1
Please expose the DirectX COM API as UWP one having the API coming from Microsoft would be a much better guarantee than relying on third partys or in-house wrappers.,1
Subscribers of the BackRequested event should be notified in stack order instead of queue order.,1
Example: In the UWP Community Toolkit the MasterDetailsView control needs to listen to the back requested event to handle navigating back when in a collapsed state with selection.,1
it would be great if user and dev could modify alarm volume.,1
The best it would be if also dev could set volume granularly on each Toast notification.,1
User might want lower volume for morning alarms and louder volume for alarm used during busy day.,1
Let the user choose between spit-screen or Anaglyph (Red-Cyan).,1
The only workaround so far is to write the text in a Win32/WPF application and then Copy&Paste the text into the appropriate fields which causes a serious security problem when working with critical passwords.,1
Please add full LDAP-Support (Query Read Write).,1
Making it possible for us to write tests and code once and have it being tested in an autonomous way.,1
Provide libraries to help me get started with Project Rome and building a cross-device experience for my application,1
Enable Linux devices to be included in a userâ€™s device graph - to enable discovery launching of apps and communication between connected devices,1
Enable iOS devices to be included in a userâ€™s device graph - to enable discovery launching of apps and communication between connected devices,1
I would like to be able to have screenshots for each and every action for a WinAppDriver like I had with CodedUI via UITestActionLog.html see https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj159363.aspx for what I am looking for.,1
It would be very useful if you allow external devices (e.g through Bluetooth) to control the running audio/video on the phone.,1
Please allow to set the display language of MapControl to one different from Windows display language.,1
Music app can provide to its users an extended network functionality such as audio streaming UPnP/DLNA or SMB/CIFS or FTP client to get music files from server UPnP/DLNA client to send audio data to renderer UPnP/DLNA media server or renderer.,1
It would be useful to have either backgroundNetwork new capability or atleast extend backgroundMediaPlayback capability and if playback is active (which can possibly be using network communication) and app is not suspended keep network communication active.,1
The only option for now would be to make a separate Pro app.,1
Please add an Azure Developer VM for Windows with Unity.,1
The Playback Devices and Recording Devices section should be merged and more info like samplerate channelcount and meters for every input and output should be added with a better UI.,1
It should also be possible to easily select the device where you want to play your system sounds but also to select two channels of a multichannel device if you need your average stereo output for most applications.,1
Therefore it would be nice to have an option like XsltSettings.EnableDocumentFunction Property in .NET apps.,1
Please add ability to Remove Azure AD association.,1
Please add to Manage users Account-level permission Show notifications for disable/enable this option.,1
Adding this may encourage more developers to port their apps to Windows from iOS and make things more familiar.,1
Please provide an API for quiet hours in Windows 10 (mobile) where developers can set the quiet hours parameters from foreground and background.,1
I would propose adding the ability for the SplitView pane to be opened by swiping in from the left side of the screen.,1
Would it be feasible to somehow make this type of offering as part of the store?,1
The xaml engine of UWP should manage complex types for xaml attributes,1
I suggest to make the xaml engine able to use an interface that lets transcode (convert) an instance to and from a string.,1
Allow the ability to Open the Explorer and show a selected file in the Explorer so that the view is already scrolled to have to file visible.,1
Advanced creation tools need to implement features like the eye dropper which allow the user to select a color on the screen and use it in the application.,1
It would be great if you could request special permission from the User (Like a Notification Manager request) and that would allow the password manager to fill password forms.,1
There would need to be some things that would probably need to be specified for that to work such as specifying a Username textbox.,1
Please add few enhancements so it accepts HTML also or add a converter which may help developers.,1
I suggest making this data more accessible so that servers can be better monitored both to track failures and to inform a cloud system it needs to scale out to more servers.,1
New HTTP Server and HttpListener APIs should be added that surface the failures and request queue state.,1
It would be great to add new status like closed or abandoned,1
Please set a limit and if you are going to ask for a description make it at least 100 or 255 characters long.,1
Windows should allow users to freely redirect media (Audio MIDI even Video someday I guess) from/to the Hardware(audio interface webcam etc) and/or Applications (even considering The Desktop as a video+audio media generator).,1
It could be as simplistic as allowing piping Apps/Devices outputs into Apps/Devices inputs through virtual interfaces managed by the user through a piping routing manager GUI.,1
There should be a native way for developers to omit their app from being able to show a preview when hovered over in the taskbar as well as preventing the screenshot that is visible in the recent apps section (on mobile).,1
We are aware of the risk of allowing an app to hide itself from the system but it would be beneficial for security software to have a means of controlling any data that may need to be hidden,1
At this point I think it might be best to just lift the restriction of insider reviews and also show more reviews regardless of version.,1
At the very least dont delete reviews from the dev center even if theyre not displayed in the store so we can use them for marketing etc,1
Why dont we support AdjacentToTopDisplayEdge and AdjacentToBottomDisplayEdge too ?,1
2) Make it possible to add the EnvironmentPermission node in the Package.appxmanifest to allow Environment variables to be retrieved.,1
Add this for Side-loaded or enterprise distributed apps on Desktop devices,1
Set up a UWP shell app to test within,1
Do the minimum to create an instance of a TCP service and add a text attribute with a key-value pair,1
In addition to existing functionality which allows to collect dump when app crashes it would be nice to have an option to collect dump of running process on Windows 10 Mobile any time you want via device portal.,1
Add a UserNotificationChangedTriggerDetails to UserNotificationChangedTrigger background task with at least:,1
My suggestion is to change the behavior of that triggers or add another pair which will fire on Lock/Unlock transitions.,1
This behavior should be fixed or a new property should be made available in the SDK to enable us to get the user defined settings for regional format.,1
We need a way to have a system wide overlay notification.,1
This could be used in the new Skype Preview app and would be EXTREMLY awesome and powerful.,1
Please update torch driver for these devices we need use torch for our apps,1
Allowing subpixel font rendering would make them look on par with desktop apps.,1
Please increase these limits (Maybe as an opt in).,1
To do so it is crucial we can remove the Close button or complete TitleBar from the TabTip keyboard.,1
Use file playback sample or custom effects sample.,1
And for the consistency of the UI design sometimes it will be nice to allow the app freely styling the buttonsespecially the close button.,1
 For example developers can hide those built-in buttons and draw their own ones and call CoreWindow.Minimize() CoreWindow.Maximize etc.,1
Looking forward to customizable window chrome for UWP apps.,1
An example is in VS I have files copied in during a build process and would like the ability to write against the.,1
So please make All versions the default.,1
can you add a new property in OCR library so that the developers can tell the engine which direction the text was written in?,1
Add support for ngening to the desktop bridge installation.,1
It would be great if MediaControl supported webm format!,1
This property needs to be implemented for mobile as well to enable a true universal app scenario.,1
I would like the ability in XAML to conditionally have my XAML output be compile with flags like you can currently with c#.,1
It would be more useful to be able to sort by Reviews Acquisitions Crashes and Ratings.,1
While this could be also a fix for Roslyn System.Runtime.CSharp.Analyzers the generated Bindings are not the owner of the disposable fields and should just ignore the warnings.,1
Please add Shell Context Menus API for UWP apps.,1
A simple property to set and get focused item would be appreciated.,1
So please add TCP timestamps option support to the StreamSocketControl class.,1
Please add a way to get a storyboard is paused.,1
What would be nice is instead of sending tile notifications for every minute if there was a way to better adjust the live tile image every minute.,1
Id also LOVE to see better extension/entrypoint/OS integration similar to App-v.,1
Please provide a template for DX12 - XAML interop.,1
Once a StorageFile or StorageFolder is allowed to be accessed by the user it SHOULD BE accessible across all those different API.,1
It would be nice to have a command-line tool to submit apps to the store.,1
Launcher.LaunchFolderAsync should accept a StorageFile as first argument.,1
It would be great to have the ability to hide all apps/categories in with Windows Store and only have it show the Private App store.,1
It would be very useful to add this feature into Hosted Web Apps so that native textboxes in a web application can inherit this capability when converted into a Hosted Web App.,1
Please fix this bug: Once a passwordBox with an InputScope=NumericPin is rendered the keyboard becomes stuck as a number pad and does not return to the full keyboard.,1
The new Notification access is awesome but is it possible to add Overlay UI and  Services  ( you will find it under accessibility settings in Android) to RS2.,1
I really want the Universal Apps to grow more powerful.,1
Solution: when open by a file type association the at least a simple dialog should ask: Allow access to all those file-types or to the folder or only that file.,1
Camera should work when app is minimized.,1
The idea is to segregate the User Interface and business logic such that the user interface will execute on users machine outside of browser/chrome as a standalone application.,1
Make it easier to register for a background task.,1
There are a lot of upcoming features to help with Fluent design and they are really great however to make full use of these the features/xaml/controls need to be backward compatible or do a fallback so that apps that do not target only the latest can also use this.,1
Please review your Package scanning portion of the application.,1
Developers should have the option to opt-out instead of the option to opt-in.,1
Having a device portal across all the different devices is a great idea.,1
Please add an API that allows to read the temperature from the device,1
Please add an option to get rid of the fade-in animation for opacity.,1
Thats why MarkdownTextBlock could offer a way to register some kind of callback function which is called whenever the control comes across a fenced code block with a specified language ID.,1
All Im asking is when a new version of Windows 10 is released please keep the old VMs still in there.,1
In fact we can use 0xE7D Share with FontIcon element without the enumeration.,1
It would be really cool if I could open a TCP/IP socket and by listening to the raw transmissions and re-send events determine how good the network quality is.,1
It would also be good for tracking the causes of uninstall spikes etc,1
It would be nice if for adaptive tiles with multiple groups where the current size cant fit all the groups those groups would automatically cycle around (similar to MSN news live tile or calendar app but in this case an individual notification would be cycling rather than a queue of separate notifications),1
Also it would be great to have the option for paid apps to be a subscription so users are charged periodically to continue using the app.,1
Some apps could benefit from an easy way to not only send a toast notification but also maintain a notification history users could view afterwards.,1
Implicit DataTemplates (not really an issue of the Pivot but would be great to have these.),1
A control similar to the FlowDocumentReader/ FlowDocumentScrollViewer would be really awesome!,1
Ive had to take ads out of my app to make it run and stop users complaining but now that means no income until this is fixed,0
The control is the equivalent of a pivot table in excel you simply add the datasets with labels and the control sorts out all the selection fields visualizations and animations.,0
lease expose Undo/Redo functions on the TextBox control so that we can trigger it programatically.,1
If would like to offer some guides to the user in our own application it could be interesting to have some interesting to be able to show a Popup that give user some indication in the app in a precise scenario (like when discovering a page the first time or when a new feature has been delivered).,1
Allow to mix two app models (JavaScript+WinJS+HTML5 and C#+XAML) inside one application,1
Make scroll viewers and lists support gestures to scroll to bottom or to top at once.,1
So if a menu is displayed and the user moves the mouse over another menu (without clicking) the first menu would close and the new one hovered over would open.,0
In fact I wonder why MS does not support this FUNDAMENTAL feature while Android and iOS already does.,0
If you create a ListView in an HTML UWP app you cant invoke an item after scolling trough it with your touchscreen.,0
Allow the placement of rectangular items in 2D,1
Make AutoSuggestBox supports AutomationProperties for test automations and accessibility.,1
Currently store access from windows is either enabled or disabled this really needs to be more granular,1
I think that app should have two ratings: one from Windows Phone 8.1 users visible to people having Windows Phone 8.1 and second one from Windows 10 Mobile users visible to Windows 10 users.,1
In the .appxmanifest one can only specify the default colors or a hex value.,0
There should be an option to enter accent to let the default splashscreen have the users accent color.,1
When using a ListView bound to a CollectionViewSource with Grouped items it would be great to have the option to make the Grouped Item selectable/interactive.,1
With mouse flyout opens on right click which is ok.,0
If i have access to the FM radio APIs i need the ability in my app to force audio to go through the speakers not the headphones.,1
I would like to programmatically set and get the volume for Windows.,1
With Windows 10 Mobile UWP and Continuum Microsoft is focusing on enterprise customers and developers so I think bringing VS to windows mobile through continuum can be game changer.,1
So that in theory our applications could report and find bugs for us.,0
It should also be possible to easily select the device where you want to play your system sounds but also to select two channels,1
Using the CreateRequestAsync method of UserCertificateEnrollmentManager and CertificateEnrollmentManager classes I noticed that the CertificatePropertiesCollection does not give us the capability of specifying enhanced key usage OIDs (for example 1.3.6.1.4.1.311.20.2.2 (SmartCard Logon) 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.4 (Secure E-Mail)) basic constraints (like Subject Type=End Entity or Path Length Constraint=none) nor the Subject Alternative Name (like RFC822 DS Object Guid ect).,0
I hope you will take this suggestion in consideration since this feature will be very useful and easy to implement by applications developers.,0
Of course it would be even better to make xaml use TypeConverter additionally for compatibilitys sake with WPF.,1
I already know workarounds using Bindings but they are not practical they need more code and they are semantically incorrect (a binding is not a transcoding/conversion they are different by nature).,0
This gives you low latency input in case of a busy UI thread.,0
I think Microsoft needs OR boost XAML development OR if it doesnt interest it open source it then the community can itself improve it...,1
Please revise that value to 12px or provide better representation solution.,1
Any media (Audio/MIDI/Video) generator/consumer (be it an app or an hardware device) should be treated as a freely connectable node instead of an hardwired starting/ending point like today.,1
The documentation indicates that it should be possible to provide an EnvironmentPermission for this to work but out of the box running this code in a UWP project never throws any of the listed exceptions if you dont specify the EnvironmentPermission.,0
Simple usage of the DNS-SD API results in the DNS Client service crashing.,0
Extremely need password protected zipping and unzipping for universal app.,1
It would be much like the Skype for desktops small call window that comes up when you are in a call.,0
Wed be much happier if we could just avoid defining these macros entirely to avoid any possible issues.,1
An API that would take 5 minutes for someone to write up and save me a lot of coding,0
PedestrianFeaturesVisible cannot be disabled if MapStyle is set to AerialWithRoads and cannot be enabled if is set to Aerial3DWithRoads.,0
I belive its critical to make the minimize maximize and close buttons customizable for building a refined UI.,1
WPF apps work much better when ngend.,0
I liked the previous Dev Center where I could compare multiple apps on the same graph and just the look in general.,0
There should be a way to define them at once.,0
Im sure making the interface public would save a number of developers a fair amount of effort and frustration.,1
It worked fairly well on WP8.1 but now on W10M when you go to the start screen until the tile notification refreshes the live tile shows the default app tile.,0
I know I can get server certificates from the server once the request is done but it should have to be done just before sending the info in the SAME request.,0
Please enhance LaunchFolderAsync to accept any IStorageItem (file or folder) as the first argument.,1
Right now we cant able to assign ItemsSource to MapIcon in here map for universal apps please allow to bind so can have easy to implement the apps having multiple Map Icons loads from database.,1
We have to provide different versions of our client application at the same time as converted app in the store.,0
For example if in the msi/ appx is added folder like Samples or Projects it cannot be found by the open/ save dialogs with set Initial Directory opened by the installed executable even if the folder is installed in the installed executables folder.,0
The new Notification access is awesome but is it possible to add Overlay UI andÊ ServicesÊ ( you will find it under accessibility settings in Android) to RS2.,1
There should be an option if the busness store settings that if checked will send the updated app to the New LOB apps section under manage apps.,1
I wish that garbage collection was optional for C# UWP apps.,1
Add an easy to use and customizable Ribbon control like the ones found in the Office Mobile apps that scales on PCs to Phones.,1
There should be a PowerShell prompt in Device Portal that lets me run extra commands.,1
It should be possible to create Visual Studio Centennial Project in WinForms WPF Win32 MFC etc which should also allow mixing of UWP Code (Like XAML UI) with full interop between native and UWP Platform.,1
My suggestion is that Microsoft create an Cordova AdControl and Mediation plugin.,1
We frequently need to automate tests that run as different test users so that we can test workflow etc.,0
Allow the developer to query Windows 10 Store with RESTfull API service.,1
Would be nice to have a market place where you can buy sample startersÊ themes and plugins from independent developers.,1
Now that Microsoft has bought Xamarin integrated it in Visual Studio and made it free it would be awesome to replace Xamarin.Forms Xaml syntax with current UWP so that Devs can benefit from all the new rich features such as RelativePanel x:Bind Adaptive Triggers Live Visual Tree etc and also no learning curve for Xamarin.Forms-specific naming conventions (e.g StackLayout instead of StackPanel),1
Id like to see support for having winappdriver log to a local file as well as support for setting log levels.,1
Would be nice to have a market place of beautifully designed apps submitted by independent developers.,1
please let me know when you will add more payment options.,0
You could consider doing the same.,0
On the screen Select the features you want to install if I select the Windows Software Development Kit feature at the bottom it installs 1.6GB worth of stuff including headers libraries and source code.,0
RCS messaging allows networks to send text messages over a data connection.,0
Up until the latest windows update the virtual keyboard worked fine but now (using my app with the most recent nuget packages) in assigned access mode (tablet mode) the keyboard closes when tapping a different inputbox on a xaml form.,0
To get the keyboard to return you have to tap it again and this happens on every single box.,0
It didnt do this before the latest update.,0
Im using a tablet with Win 10 Pro build 1709,0
2 Hot plug device to unit and idle about 1min,0
Found BSOD(0xe6) occurred.FR:1/50,0
I have chick bug code 0xe6 is DRIVER_VERIFIER_DMA_VIOLATION.,0
I use driver verifier to see what happen but when restart where did I find my log file or result.And how to fix it.,0
I can see it relative with USBXHCI.But I have no idea.,0
Often the same command is available in an app through different ways.,0
It might be placed in a MenuFlyout in a Button in a AppBarButton.,0
The problem is that all these controls have different properties for the text content:,0
All with the same original and translated text for all languages!,0
It is pretty annoying having to duplicate lots or resources just becase the same command has now moved to a different control.,0
Currently you cannot create an Emitter unless you are using 48K Wave audio.,0
Back in DirectSound you could do L/R panning with any Wave sample-rate.,0
One of the benefits of migrating to AudioGraph is support for mp3 & other files but if you want do panning you still have to convert them first.,0
I am looking after a solution already over a decade for 3D mouses working over Windows Remote Desktop Connection.,0
Still today 3D mouses USB-connected to the local computer and used over a remote desktop connection to external server are not working properly.,0
On the field there are hundreds of CAD industrial designers and other engineers still not able to use a 3D mouse on the remote server over Microsoft RDC.,0
Normal mouses are working fine but 3D mouse such a SpaceNavigator from 3D Connexion is only able to zoom over RDC.,0
Other competitors such as Citrix and HP have already solved this issue with their own Remote Desktop clients.,0
Would still keep the Instance property to prevent breaking changes,0
App language is English (FlowDirection: LTR),0
Swiping a SwipeControl item from the right to the left will reveal the options on the right (as if dragging the item to the left revealing options behind it.,0
User changes the language to Arabic (FlowDirection: RTL),0
Expectation: User swipes from the left to the right to reveal the options on the left (as if dragging the item to the right to reveal options behind it),0
Currently: user swipes from the right to the left to reveal the options on the left (as if the item is moving in the opposite direction of the dragging motion.,0
Developers will pass in a UPN (user@domain.com) which will bypass the initial Realm Discovery Dialog - thereby reducing the number of dialogs the user sees during login to the graph.,0
We use MediaComposition to generate thumbnails for mp4 video files.,0
Its working great on physical machines.,0
But on virtual machines we get a InvalidCastException.,0
Its happening on multiple different virtualizers (Parallels VirtualBox ...).,0
Here is a small testing UWP app:,0
Ive also posted the full exception there.,0
Transferring large amounts of data (10kB) takes way to long when transferred via BLE using native windows functionality as the min connection interval seems to be quite large.,0
Using an BLE-Dongle via HCI where it is(!),0
possible to set the min conncetion interval the transfer duration of the same data is approximately four times lower than with native BLE.,0
Not able to retrieve MAC address of device.,0
Without a Header Attribute for the Button Control... it looks like ****... and doesnt line up....,0
That would be sort of like going to Starbucks and telling the casher person to leaving room for Cream in your Coffee... where the cream layer is for your Headers....,0
The reason why Button needs a Header Attribute is because if I make a grid of a TextBox with Header Field set and a place a button next to it... it looks likes like **** without the header padding to push the button down.,0
Ideally some way to disable the bing maps access explicitly plus some smart watermark (i.e. 1 ms resolution.),0
I believe there is progress coming way for this issue already but I want to post it just to show my desire for it.,0
I am attempting to use lsof to find an open port for an application but rather it returns sock: cant identify protocol.,0
This occurs because /proc/net/tcp is empty and thus the socket cannot be identified as TCP.,0
Now I have a painful regime of monkey motion to go through to test them one by one (even with binary search its going to be painful).,0
Thanks in advance for considering this.,0
The new WinRT MIDI APIs are broken and have been since their introduction with no sign of plans to be fixed.,0
In addition the functionality they provide is still lacking compared to other platforms.,0
There is information on this in the other MIDI topics on this page and on GitHub if you do an issue search for winrt midi or uwp midi.,0
Delete all Universal Windows Platform,0
There is no way to get battery usage of system display Wifi Mobile Data etc.,0
But this details are available in BATTERY USE settings,0
Currently it only supports touch input.,0
I appreciate that swipe controls have come out of developments around touch interfaces.,0
Microsoft have set precedent for this in their own apps.,0
Outlook for example utilises a SwipeControl type arrangement (that can be interacted with using a mouse) for marking emails as read or unread (among other things).,0
And I have a problem with windows explorer that it breaks every time when I try to move from one screen to another.,0
I just figured out what was the problem and I can work with it without any problem but I want to post it to see if it can be fixed for another user.,0
How to emulate the bug,0
" ""- Now with the mouse pointer click on the title of the window and move it to the second screen.""",0
the problem that I get is that the window will flash and crash the solution is to close it in the taskbar restart the explorer process.,0
I have an always on background Desktop Bridge app that some users might want to be elevated when it starts at logon.,0
isalnum(-1) returns true for some codepages.,0
Compile using cl test.cpp /MD and run under RS4.,0
WebAuthenticationBroker is becoming obsolete as websites like GitHub are dropping support of the IE browser.,0
Working in ABO (Activity Based Office) I use different hardware to my Surface all the time.,0
Each time I sit down the display setting for the external screen is to clone but I want it to be extended.,0
My Customer (Im an Office 365 Consultant) are struggling with the adoption of this new way of working because of simple things like this that annoy and takes 2-10 minutes per person per working spot.,0
The following example doesnt show an error in the Designer but throws errors in the generated code.,0
The above case is trying to subtract from the width of another element but clamp it within a specific range.,0
Currently it seems to be sorted by Unicode code points which doesnt make any sense for Chinese characters at least.,0
I have a disk imaging application (which I have already converted) that writes bytes directly to disk (USB and SD cards).,0
It requires admin rights to get a lock on the disk.,0
There are thousands of apps out there that probably arent converted for similar reasons.,0
Test apps (although hidden in the store) undergo the same certification process.,0
The submission process for test apps takes too long.,0
I have been trying to get my son into programming and so far his dev experience has been less than exciting.,0
He wants to debug his game real time but the emulator is a pain to deal with forces and gps etc.,0
Allegedly this works however I have found thread after thread of people looking for a real solution but no one appears to make any headway because VS gives useless feedback.,0
I have spent an entire day trying to get something anything working.,0
if I choose device I get a generic error (vie tried every suggestion I can find online) if I choose remote machine I am prompted for a pin so I go into the for devs page on my device and I hit pair and I get a 6 digit pin.,0
that pin doesnt work though so the pin screen wont go away.,0
I was able to finally build an app package that I can manually move o the device in the portal but I shouldnt have to do that and it breaks the debug chain.,0
The link to the PrinterExtensionLibrary for UWP points to 8.1.,0
Is that be design?,0
Hello I am new to the forum so I apologize if this is not in the incorrect area to post this.,0
I am active Windows Insider users currently enrolled to receive the fastest Windows Inside Builds.,0
I currently use Cortana each day on Windows 10 Android and iPhone.,0
I have noticed that sometimes the microphone function on the iPhone and Android app tends to stall or freeze.,0
I understand the limitations of Apple so its unlikely the user will be able to respond to a text message directly on a Windows 10 PC.,0
For example when I want to go to my user path just Ctrl + R enter ~ then press Enter.,0
Or want to go to System drive path currently I press Windows key enter C: then press enter.,0
My country Maldives isnt listed in Aure sign up.,0
The ability to use products like Office with VR.,0
I can program my buttons in my Vive to mimic my fingers.,0
I have a driver causing a memory leak.,0
Poolmon is not offered as a standalone tool and only as part of the Windows Driver Kit so I must download the entire Windows Driver Kit to access this one small tool.,0
In order to download the Windows Driver Kit I must first install Visual Studio 2017.,0
I am not going to download multiple GBs of **** that I will never use to fix a memory leak.,0
That just turns my memory leak issue into a hard-drive bloat issue.,0
Thanks for nothing Microsoft.,0
Microsofts official support reccomends that I use a tool called poolmon to find which driver is causing the leak.,0
Scenario: An application saving different file formats with the same file extension (example: choices for TXT files when saving with Excel MS Office).,0
Case (tested): When using FileSavePicker with UWP even if the application adds different choices with the same file extension then it is not possible to know which of those choices the user actually selected.,0
FileSavePicker just returns a StorageFile class for the file name and extension.,0
Issue: I developed a Desktop application saving files with different formats with the same file extension (using SaveFileDialog and FilterIndex) and currently UWP would not allow me to convert the application from Desktop without adding additional menu options or dialogs so the user can chose what he/she wants.,0
This means adding more steps to select something that is already shown on the FileSavePicker dialog which I think it would eventually affect in a way the user experience.,0
This is the crezy idea:,0
could try again to develop great software again as many years before which your customers want to install themselves because its just fun to work with and it brings great benefits to users.,0
How about letting the user decide whether My People should use these animated notifications or normal Toasts.,1
Im missing the ability to change the font name/size and color.,0
Im not a developer.,0
Im a school teacher.,0
I am considering future options for puchasing devices.,0
There doesnt seem to be any website for this.,0
I understand that cloudbooks are meant to largely be web based tools.,0
But there are still times when you want to install some things.,0
I also understand that this will be something that software manufacturers will be requesting to MS directly.,0
With F# still not providing a way to code a full application for the desktop using UWP after several years of people waiting I want to call for bringing Common Lisp to the platform.,0
Machines now have the power to really make Lisp shine and show all it can do to empower UWP developers to create amazing solutions.,0
The users that are already subscribed to the Add-on will keep the same price as before but the new Users will get the new price.,0
Whats the reason that currently Microsoft is blocking a price increase?,0
Its not really convenient for developers to create every time a new Add-on when they want to increase the price.,0
We tried to embrace Microsofts vision for UWP but failed misreably wasting lots of time and money.,0
We built a UWP application that reads public data off ISO 7816 smart cards successfully until we realized that the app fails to function in release mode.,0
In debug mode it all works fine.,0
In release mode we generate the appx and it passes windows certification.,0
The smartcard functionality however which is based on a .net standard 2.0 library fails to work (https://github.com/danm-de/pcsc-sharp),0
We are now trying to use the native UWP SmartCard API but its largely useless as we cannot find any methods to construct and transmit APDU which are the basic communication block,0
For now we have no option but to re-build the app to a non-Microsoft environment.,0
The wireless card worked well till windows 7.,0
Now this is a mess.,0
Intel says they cannot Give update.,0
I have to do it whenever there is some heavy thing between Computer and Hub.,0
Microsoft can set a Do while loop in its generic drivers Also,0
it wont let me cconnect it just sais turn on,0
The following page https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/preview/ does not work in IE.,0
I cannot expand FAQ entries and so on.,0
The page above also recommends me to set up the MS Edge.,0
The MS Edge is incompatible with my LTSB system.,0
For some languages - Chinese for example - ink recognition results tend to have lots of errors.,0
Here is a related StackOverflow question:,0
In UWP I extract the pages of a PDF using the method PdfDocument.GetPage(UInt32 pageIndex) and save the page as image to the local disk using PdfPage.RenderToStreamAsync(IRandomAccessStream outputStream).,0
In the saved image the headers in the PDF pages are not rendered.,0
The sample and the PDF document can be downloaded from the link below.,0
This is so ridiculous that windows update doesnt have any rule and there is no way (believe me I googled a lot) to allow it securely (without allowing whole svhost.exe) even spotify has a default rule!,0
Im using lates windows 10 edition (build 1709),0
Please dont reply me with this: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/cc708605(v=ws.10),0
There is no way for adding dns names in windows firewall and also it is not secure.,0
I already tried renaming svhost.exe with no luck.,0
I changed the windows firewall default to block anything without a rule.,0
Both Process Isolation and Hyper-V Isolation for Containers are available in Windows Server 2016 but Windows 10 only supports Hyper-V isolation.,0
Hyper-V isolation has benefits but also has many drawbacks such as resource allocation performance as well as stability.,0
A simple check of the Docker for Windows issues board ( https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues ) shows a large imbalance of Windows 10 and Hyper-V isolation related issued where the Windows Server 2016 issues are much less common.,0
Hello I want to protect some user-mode code and read only data against other user-mode modification from a kernel-mode driver while allowing process handle creation.,0
MmSecureVirtualMemoryAgainstWrites seems to do the job but its undocumented and not even exported.,0
In my enterprise application basically a sales and purchase application.,0
Currently UWP allow RenderTargetBitmap API to render framework element in xaml to image which currently in viewed in screen.,0
But in my case i want to print receipt and dont want to show the receipt in the screen and just pass the bitmap image of receipt to POS Printer.,0
But RenderTargetBitmap API doesnt work in Background.,0
In UWP XAML binding something that is NOT an ICommand to an event gives an exception in the XAML compiler WCM9999: Object Reference not set to an instance of an object.,0
I would expect it to catch this an give a readable error message about an invalid binding idealy the propertyname and the control type at least.,0
Something that lets you investigate.,0
Using Microsoft gift cards as developer account registration fee.,0
well its really powerful for indie devs,0
Lets say there is a app which display news stories.,0
The app does not want to have too many stories on the screen and load stories on demand.,0
The first time the app is opened it downloads news article and displays say the top 10 to user in a ListView and rest are stored locally.,0
These are displayed if the user scrolls down (Incremental Loading Collection Helpers are great addition).,0
Now lets say next day the app is opened again.,0
App immediately displays yesterdays news stories and works in background to load new stories (or user pulls to refresh).,0
As soon as new stories are downloaded they are added at the from of the ListView not all but say top 10 and rest goes to the disk/cache.,0
Now if user scrolls down more stories are fetched from the cache/disk.,0
on Windows 10 UWP apps if you rapidly click or unintentionally double-click on any control supporting click/tapped event its associated Click event handler will execute for each.,0
This can cause a lot of unintended side effects.,0
For example if the Click event handler brings up a modal ContentDialog with the ShowAsync command an additional click will cause the event handler to fire again before modal isolation occurs and create another ContentDialog which causes an exception if not handled will result in a crash of the application.,0
Tablet Version: Microsoft Windows [version 10.0.16299.248],0
It used to do this in Windows 8 and early Windows 10 versions but this apparently changed a while ago.,0
This will be a good addition.,0
Without this support if a desktop bridge contains a UWP app and a win32 app exposes out-of-proc COM objects the only way UWP app can communicate with the win32 app is through AppService.,0
This brings a lot of overhead and unnecessary work to add AppService into win32 app and sometimes it is impossible if win32 source code is not available.,0
Packaged COM (https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2017/04/13/com-server-ole-document-support-desktop-bridge/#KgekWJeWFmOwUZRb.97) allows exposing out-of-proc COM objects using desktop bridge however these COM objects are not accessible from UWP apps even if the UWP apps are packaged into same desktop bridge exposes the COM objects.,0
We are a dev house that specialises in publishing dedicated Xbox Apps.,0
It used to be that there was a really high standard to get certified on Xbox which was tough to get through but at least the standard of apps was pretty high.,0
Now it seems there is zero standard to be certified to publish an app on Xbox and by default EVERY windows 10 app that is published is published on all devices.,0
I know microsoft is trying to flesh out the app stores on each device - but it means that when we publish an app now our app is barely out a day and it is pushed way down the new apps list - making it almost impossible to generate organic downloads from curious users.,0
That is fine if we are being kept out by other Xbox apps - but we released an app last week and currently there are about 2 dozens apps ahead of us - half that wont even work on an Xbox with a controller.,0
It is totally crazy and really counterproductive to building any kind of a vibrant ecosystem.,0
One simple example is there is a PDF database app on the new apps list on XBOX!,0
You cannot use it it cannot access files and it has absolutely no viable function on Xbox One.,0
Yet somehow this passes certification and is thrown on the pile of rubbish that now clutters the new app section.,0
It is hugely frustrating to put months of work into building an app for xbox and stand no chance of getting it downloaded because nobody will ever be able to find it.,0
I know microsoft is trying to flesh out the app stores on each device,0
Currently desktop bridge supports in app purchases.,0
As of now there is no good ad network for existing desktop applications.,0
This feature is almost available in any web based video player or any Desktop based video player the feature is simple.,0
When a mediaplayerelement is playing or paused a video.,0
and the user hover overs the seekbar with mouse or pen or any other input device for that perspective wherver is the user mouse show a small thumbnail of the video file at that specific position just above the seekbar ( slider ) and as the user moves the mouse along the seekbar the thumbnail should update accordingly.,1
Im aware of the sandboxing.,0
In UWP applications with the codeGeneration manifest capability allow the use of the existing exception table APIs currently marked desktop-only.,1
On UWP for x86-64 ARM and ARM64 its not possible to comply with the Windows ABI when generating code at runtime because you cannot generate the mandatory exception table data for the dynamically-generated code.,0
Otherwise this function is useful to runtime code generation.,0
So I uninstalled KB4057144 became build 15063.850.,0
Re-try desktop app converter was successes.,0
I think that it is the problem of baseimage and KB4057144.,0
Of course Version 1709 build 16299.214 can use the DAC.,0
Currently Microsoft Store under Windows 10 shows three types of information:,0
But theres no numerical value representing the amount of data that will have to be downloaded.,0
Please fix this annoying issue.,0
Many applications need only Desktop support.,0
UWP is too safe so as to be impractical for so many desktop apps and WPF is like a third-class citizen with Microsoft in the background cheering Upgrade to UWP!,0
The sandbox nonsense has to go.,0
Let them install it if they so choose.,0
99% of the applications they install arent (and wont be!) sandboxed UWP applications anyway.,0
But it is not available by default.,0
im using file explorer but if ? can seee my otler drives like D drive ore E drive ?ts gona be more handfull,0
CalcBinding is an advanced Binding markup extension that allows you to write calculated binding expressions in XAML without custom converters.,0
CalcBinding can automatically perform bool to visibility conversion inverse your expression and more.,0
CalcBinding makes binding expressions shorter and more user-friendly.,0
This is only available for WPF - https://github.com/Alex141/CalcBinding,0
Here are some examples,0
Right now its possible to define apps for websites using app URI handlers.,0
These excludePaths feature supports only path matching right now not wildcards for the whole Uri.,0
UWP combobox is not showing the selected value under certain resolutions.,0
In visual studio if I select the container (a grid) and change something like the flow from horizontal to vertical the redraw fixes the issue which leads me to believe that its the render.,0
We use the Create Date on log files to check if they can be deleted.,0
The problem is that when we delete that file and recreate it (same filename) the create date stays the same!,0
How to reproduce.,0
It creates a test.log file.,0
Run the code again.,0
The test.log file is created again.,0
Check the create on the test.log it still has the create date from the first time you ran the code!,0
Run this as many times as you like the create date will not change from the first time you ran the code.,0
It deletes the file.,0
Having SOCK_SEQPACKET would remove the burden of distinguishing between independent messages from the user.,1
It also allows greater compatibility for existing POSIX-compatible applications as was the original goal for implementing AF_UNIX.,0
This would be comparable to the message mode of Windows named pipes making AF_UNIX sockets a more complete replacement.,0
Some users certainly will find this useful.,0
Sadly if youre someone who finds this annoying theres no option to disable this behavior.,0
According to the singular post I was able to find on this new feature (https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_desktop/programs-autostart-after-boot-in-windows-10/09dd8d3e-7b36-45d1-9181-6587dd5d53ab?page=2&auth=1) there is no way to disable this.,0
The new fall creators update seems to have introduced a feature where if a user reboots the system any applications that were open (well some at least it seems as though to make this issue even more confusing not all applications follow this convention) will automatically launch on reboot.,0
Others may find this annoying.,0
It currently only supports octet-stream.,0
In trying to use SHA2 Timestamp(current Microsoft guidelines) servers the powershell cmdlet set-authenticodesignature fails to apply the timestamp.,0
This cmdlet uses the cryptuiwiz api.,0
Heres the sample script to reproduce the error,0
Actually we cant because the same notification would be send too if the user is closing the application.,0
This issue was reported for Visual Studio Feedback Site but They have determined that this issue belongs to universal windows platform.,0
Currently we have no notifying system to the developers when the customer add new feedback to the feedback hub.,0
Its tooo painful.,0
Is it possible to add the notification system?,1
Uservoice already have it.,0
Its a control carryover from as far back as W95 & W98 ...... Linux & Mac system systems have never had this issue,0
Create a new blank UWP application and add this XAML code:,0
When I run this I expect to get no suggestions in the software keyboard when writing anything in the text box.,0
This works as expected on phones but not on computers/tablets.,0
Im using Fall Creators update not sure how it behaves in other versions.,0
In my case Im writing an app where you learn how to spell and dont want to give the user any hints :-),0
We are developing components on Linux which has dedicated system call and memory requests.,0
This would signify communication and access on the file system.,0
I have some more feature recommendations regarding extensions in adaptivegridview if you will.,0
and which operator to use [AND/OR] in case of multiple property filter provided.),0
and this grouping will obviously include the semantic zoom feature as well.,0
Incremental Loading: I know this is already in the community toolkit.,0
Sorting : sorting with 1 or more properties.,0
List/GridSwitcher : there can be a toggle button on the top of the control which can toggle the control to view as a listview ( each item expanded fully ) or to a gridview ( normal grid like behaviour ),1
These are some of the most common scenarios which are required by developers and there are many ways to do it but this can get very complicated to align them with best practices.,0
This can be a very powerful control/page yet looking very good to the eye as well.,0
this search bar auto filters the items on basis of the filterDescriptor provided ( filter descriptor can be defined by the developer tht which stringtimeint property to match with which condition i.e : Contains startswith endswith e.t.c.,0
I have used Unity+UWP to develop LOB application that visualizes 3D data from opened files.,0
We also use multiple-top-level windows that are already available.,0
Now client wants to allow opening and visualizing multiple files which would have been easy with Win32 (just launch another instance).,0
I have a disk imaging (which I have already converted) application that writes bytes directly to disk (USB and SD cards).,0
The app gets rejected during submission to the store as some features are disabled as admin privileges are required.,0
So in a round about way youre actually raising the chances of users getting viruses by blocking these apps as they just get them from the web instead.,0
Current clipboard API can notify about a clipboard content change which is fine.,0
This limitation results in a bad user experience because there are scenarios where the user is working with one application and another application performs some operations based on the copied content.,0
But getting or setting the content doesnt work if the app is in background or unfocused.,0
Currently the input will be validated if the focus of the Textbox lost.,0
I can verify that this works.,0
But unfortunately it is not possible to create a MediaStreamSample from D3D Surface.,0
This will allow us to do full hardware accelerated video decoding.,0
x:Bind is great and I love it.,0
This limit appears to be arbitrary and not on par with other platforms (iOS / Android / Mac OSX).,0
This limitation is a contribution to a diminished user experience (and developer experience) when compared to these other platforms.,0
This idea is so bad on so many levels.,0
So what is the suggestion:,0
As a Xamarin.Forms developer I had to drill down 4 frameworks to find this limitation.,0
As bad as the Android docs are they at least make an effort to publish limits.,0
Especially if that steam roller is riddled with security issues and complexity way beyond the experience and latitude of most fly swatter users.,0
In [this](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/sqlserver/en-US/6187a2cc-2683-4b15-b1e6-d90f3703ad0b/uwp-c-emailmanager-message-body-getting-truncated?forum=wpdevelop&prof=required) following forum post the character limit for an email body generated via code from an app is noted.,0
ContentDialog is currently far too difficult to use for two reasons: locking and placement.,0
Since only one ContentDialog can be shown at a time a lock is needed (such as SemaphoreSlim(11) or a sequential queue of TaskCompletionSource).,1
In other words the class is not complete because normal use of it requires wrapping it in additional code.,0
This means that ContentDialog.ShowAsync will wait until any currently-displayed ContentDialog is dismissed before showing the new dialog.,0
If ShowAsync() or ShowAsync( ContentDialogPlacement.Popup) is used then the location of the dialog is not well controlled.,0
On the other hand if ShowAsync( ContentDialogPlacement.InPlace) is used then (a) it is not convenient because one must separately embed the dialog in XAML and (b) it doesnt always work because an exception occurs if ShowAsync(InPlace) is called on the dialog before the XAML is fully loaded.,0
For example an error dialog that is required early during program startup cannot be shown based on a copy embedded in XAML.,0
(In addition per (1) above a lock of some kind is needed).,0
Currently when the last element(s) of the tile doesnt fit (because of users with unusual scaling settings for example) it gets discarded out of view which is understandable.,0
It also helps with dealing with the scenario where because of the users scaling settings there is too much space on the tile where the developer could have shown extra info.,0
PasswordVault.FindAllByResource throws a COMException when there are no credentials for the resource (or maybe only when there are no credentials).,0
It should return an empty list without throwing an exception.,0
right now the window.closed event for desktop fires both for minimization and for closing events.,0
I understand this is done because of the multiplatform support but it just makes desktop apps with multiple Windows harder 5o manage so please.,0
A good web example can be found here https://material.angular.io/components/chips/overview,0
We are able to download previous versions of the release versions of the Windows SDK.,0
On the slow ring we are currently on Windows build 17025 but the only SDK download link provided on the Windows Insider download page is for 17061 at time of writing.,0
I am not willing to go to fast ring because this renders my laptop useless.,0
When you invoke the primary or secondary buttons in a ContentDialog you are not losing focus in the control that was last being edited.,0
If you are using x:Bind to bind that controls value to a property in the ContentDialog code-behind page then when you press the primary button the property doesnt get updated.,0
Ive tried forcing the control (in this case a TextBox) to lose focus programmatically in the Primary buttonevent handler but this does not help.,0
Ive also tried Bindings.Update - bit this does not help either.,0
The expected behaviour is that when you click on the Primary,0
I cant register dev account because of living in Republic of Moldova.,0
There are thousands of programmists here too.,0
Currently there does not appear to be a way to set a windows startup position (left top width/right height/bottom) beyond full-screen and/or maximized.,0
Also the last used position for a given window isnt saved intrinsically.,0
Windows launch at random places on the desktop.,0
I understand this need does not really exist for mobile.,0
But for many desktop applications specifically container applications managing windows is a core feature objective.,0
it is similar like this issue : http://www.dcfever.com/cameras/specification.php?id=1620,0
Weve inherit a control from Slider and put it in horizontal.,0
If Windows set to 125% DPI and when slider value is the same as its maximum value.,0
Our App would crash.,0
If we use Application.ExecutablePath when the user open the Shortcut he gets an access permission error so Im trying to create it using shell:AppsFolder but I cant get the AppUserModelId,0
Im on a DesktopBridge App and when I try to use Windows.ApplicationModel.AppInfo its null,0
Setting ProtextedText to On doesnt work the selected text is still modifiable.,0
Editor is the value of x:Name given to RichEditBox element.,0
RotatorTiles behavior is like an automated FlipView.,0
Microsoft has added in the Camera App the Panorama Mode which works in some devices and tablets.,0
Dont know if it is a specific number of devices that currently this feature works.,0
Is this possible to use this feature in our Windows App Store Universal Apps and if we can  do we have any sample code to accomplish this ?,0
Dont want a solution with the scrollviewer and the compass because I have already done that.,0
The app list should be in grid style and background should be customized.,1
The keyborad should also be customized like the gadget comfort on-screen keyboard in windows 7 (desktop).,1
Please allow us to maintain all app packages store assets descriptions screenshots and metadata in a Git repository and simply push to a Git remote to upload.,1
Instead we could get everything ready locally and do a push and upload it all quickly.,1
What I would like to see is a button on the language description pages that are supported for an app.,1
and put it onto the description field for Japanese for example) For my app I have it in about 36 language/Country descriptions which is a big task to handle.,0
The user could then review the translations as best as they could.,0
And if Microsoft couldnt translate it it could just copy over the original text.,0
That would take your default language description and fields and then use Microsofts Translator to translate all the fields to the language.,0
Please add support C++/CX extension and type system for Desktop platform.,1
And its good if it will be work on Windows 7 too.,1
Please comment and document this behavior,1
Therefore I want to request adding of some improvements in WinRT API to bring Frames behavior closer to its analog from WP Silverlight.,1
So would be great if Microsoft things in this way also.,0
It should be typed as it is typed in Gujarati ????.,0
It would be great to have a Background Trigger when that data was changed on another device.,1
It is great that we can Schedule Tile updates so that I can always show the latest timings on the tile itself but I would love it if I could do the same thing with Badges.,1
Attempting to use TextAlignment within Page.Resources and referencing it via StaticResource in a Universal Windows App will compile but throw an exception.,0
When Cortana has an expression that it doesnt understand based on the available expressions registered but Cortana does recognize an app name it would be great if the users expression was fed to the app account on the store for the developer to review and consider supporting in the future.,1
Window should stay the size I left it.,1
Please add CAN API to be included in the Windows.Devices.,1
Companies like CSHTML5 (http://cshtml5.com) and DuoCode (http://duoco.de) are already doing this but it would be great to see this effort officially adopted into the Microsoft Universal Windows Platform.,0
A mechanism that operates like PhoneGap/Cordova would have to be implemented so that access to external hardware APIs can be achieved.,1
A Bonus would be to be able to set a link for all users (incl. .Net API preferred at least Win32 API,1
Hope there are some automated tool for taking localised screenshots.,0
My thought: Using simulator while on a page a one-click button that automatically take one screenshot for each language the app supports.,0
In the upload website a way to remove all screenshots and a way to upload all assets for all languages at once.,1
Developers should be able to make custom lockscreen app.,1
It is very important that we support beta for both Windows Phone and Windows.,1
Allow users of paint to select parts of images on an image theyre drawing or editing diagonally other than only horizontally/vertically.,1
You could even make it possible to select the angle at which you select a certain part of the image manually and this would certainly make editing in paint a lot easier.,1
Please provide the ability to the developer to change the color of the keyboard inside their app.,1
Now this may not be so bad in English which has relatively short words but languages like German or Danish make heavy use of compound words.,0
Words can get very long and thus hyphenation is needed - especially on small screens.,1
This would also bring feature parity with HTML/JS apps which already… more,0
API to detect incoming call and number so it can be blocked if not necessary and also can ring even in silent if it is important.,1
It would be great to have the option for creating Publisher’s shared roaming folder as well.,1
Open sideloading for everyone.,1
It would be better if this file was in JSON format and followed the Manifest for web application standard from W3C: http://www.w3.org/TR/appmanifest/,1
Allow changing country and publisher name after registration on the Store,1
Please either extend the existing class to consider the use cases for the phone or ditch it and come up with something more like Apples approach which works better than whats currently there.,1
Unfortunately this means the app is a none-starter because the files can be several gigabytes in size so it kills the user experience everytime they try to open a file.,0
The Emulator should support SensorSDK,1
I propose you add a proper unit test suite for the WinJS platform that can be automated and ideally run from common JavaScript tools like Grunt.,1
Please document how transitions work and expose the necessary API for us to create our own drop in replacements for the limited set of transitions supplied by the existing APIs.,1
For example on WP if I want to use a custom transition I can fake the transition by using animations at the exit and entry to a page but in order for this to work I need to remove the existing stack of transitions from the frame because navigation will reuse the last transition from the frames collection.,0
At the very least we need a No Op transition that can be used to prevent the frames stack from using the last transition to animate the page change.,1
This feature is to ask for Xaml serialization featureset parity with WPF/System.Xaml.,1
It could be better to have search box in windows phone application instead of having it in windows application alone.,1
Auto focusing the input element in page ready is not working in windows mobile application.,0
As a developer I should have access to the entire WinRT API if I am building an app for my own personal device.,1
Perhaps more developers would build for Windows if they can build their own tools for personal use without so many restrictions.,1
This is an excellent feature but I would love to see the same tools and support available for the shared project in a universal WinJS app.,1
It would be great to use Bower to install scripts once into the shared project rather than installing two copies of the same script into the Windows project and the Windows Phone project.,1
It makes sense to disallow universal C#/Xaml apps installing packages to the shared project because they might only target Windows 8 or only target Windows Phone.,1
Therefore there should be no problem with installing scripts directly to the shared project using Bower instead of installing two copies of the same script to two different projects.,0
It would make sense i think that en (no region) language will be used as a fallback for all en countries if there is no en-region specified.,1
Please implement a permanent fix to the relevant back-end systems.,1
Also we need a supplementary fix to the issues faced by existing affected users without resorting them to contacting Microsoft customer support to restore their purchase by way of adding credit to re-purchase the app.,1
If you add more than a few like 25+ the performance is so bad that you have to wait for a few seconds after you stop to be sure that the pins/controls are in the right position.,0
Either use the Identity version throughout the Store and let us change that with the Visual Studio Wizard or ensure that the Dev Center reads the Package version (rather than Identity version).,1
Visual Studios Create Package wizard allows one to assign a version number however this assigns the Package version number.,0
I would like some way so that I can have my various devices (each with different form factor) get the latest build deployed to them all or a select number of them instead of debugging simply failing.,1
PubCenter users should be able to decide how much they want to receive when they get a payment.,1
It would be great if I could decide to receive less money in a single payment and keep the rest for the next year.,1
Expose an API that allows apps aside Phone and Messaging to trigger Person reminders.,1
Polish your new Contact Manager api to get the maximum performance .Hence the user not to sit idle till it loads.,1
It may be based on number only contacts contacts with email address or filtering only phone contacts other than any social contacts etc.,0
Please consider my suggestion on this case,0
Please provide a simpler example with a clearer coding.,1
I think it is good to explain what is default image.,1
Please provide support for adding developer user id to Windows Developer account.,1
Hope that Microsoft (if possible) allow us individuals to create individual developer account for FREE and allowed only to publish one app on Windows Phone or Windows store.,1
Please add a link to https://dev.windowsphone.com/en-us/Account/Summary that links to the password change page at https://dev.windowsphone.com.,1
Also add the same LIVE profile password change link to the Windows Store profile.,1
Might be nice to make it easier to find the right password change page.,1
Allow background services to display controls on top of other applications.,1
It would be great to for example play a video in a small square box while browsing the web or respond to messages without having to open a message app.,1
Please support m3u8 live streamings,1
Please Please Please expand the Email Signature function so that you are able to include a detailed signature including embeded images.,1
By using the FileOpenPicker class we can filter shown files by extensión but I think we should also be able to filter files by their name lets say: I only want to show pictures whose name start with ABCD or whose name ends with  BCD.,1
So Please Provide this option.,0
The dev team should be able to access info through the dashboard.,1
Make .Net available on all platforms(including Mac Linux all Smartphones).,1
Microsoft could have created more tools for integrating NHibernate easily into .net apps but they developed EntityFramework instead… more,1
Just like in WinRT could we have Spell Checking options and Text Prediction in Window Phone Silverlight apps.,1
I was working on clipboard manager application for windows 8 and discovered that there is no way to catch Clipboard.ContentChanged event when application is running in background seems the life cycle of WinRT app doesnt allow this.,0
Wish I would have a possibility to create a background task that is triggered by clipboard content changed system event.,1
Add WebP support so I can easily process and export images using the format.,1
We want access to every camera available at same tima.,1
I think there should be a property (maybe something like ShowDeleteButton) that allows you to specify whether the Delete button is displayed.,1
A/B testing is crucial for quantitative marketing.,0
Id like to see the ability to re-order my related apps so I can choose which related apps get promoted first to users.,1
Let the local apps install without need to access to windows phone store just like .exe files in windows...,1
After profiling the app I found that after calling MediaCapture.capturePhotoToStorageFileAsync method memory is not released and allocates 10-20 MB with each call.,0
Ive also voted for this suggestion as that could fix most of camera related issues on Windows phone:,0
The only way to detect it is by looking for UnauthorizedException but that exception is ambiguous.,0
A location permission dialog may be showing when a network error occurs in an unrelated part of the code for example.,0
Perhaps ensuring a 1 year gap between signups would be enough of a deterrent to those that may want to maliciously close their account regularly.,1
Please include my country Yemen in pay out and advertisement too.,1
DatePicker should be allowed to have a null value initially and not a programmatically set that could accidentally be mistake for a users input.,1
Setting DayVisible to false prevents the spinner from showing which is nice but then the date is displayed when the value is shown in the field which sort of negates the feature.,0
It would be nice if an app could provide its own tasks / todos to the OS.,1
I do alot of copying and pasting and would really like to see a customized copy and paste built into windows.,1
That way when I paste I still have the other files in memory to paste elsewhere.,0
If I can copy like say 4 - 10 different files/folders it would be nice to have a selection when I right click and place my mouse over paste I would like to see a Paste - All Paste select which would have check boxes on each folder/file I have selected to copy.,1
Please provide APIs and support of iBeacons technology and also BLE scanning without pairing just like using Advertising Package so that we can exchange data to or from target device.,1
Replace Most Used Tags/attributes With Number.,1
all the developers needs to do is some thing like this:,0
If you think about productivity this is not a way to do it.,0
Allow changing the country and name after registration on Windows Phone Store PubCenter and Windows Store.,1
Pubcenter Ads should not play sound unless clicked on or have a way to mute ad sounds.,1
Allow developers to add suggestions to the users wordflow keyboard.,1
You might throw up a MessageDialog in the catch clause.,0
It would be nice to have a ShowForAsyncAction method or something so that you have one call and dont have to worry about cleanup.,1
It would be nice to have one thing with three states rather than two things who have two states each.,1
Developers need to write additional code -using the deprecated DirectInput API- to access those devices even though Microsoft states that use of DirectInput should be avoided and XInput used instead for any gamepad functionality.,0
There should be an update to XInput API that will add functions so to migrate and simplify that functionality from DirectInput.,1
You should also be able to undelete an app package for 24 hours after you delete.,1
You should also be able make a backup of this information so if it does get delete you can always restore it.,1
For the testcase source code see below.,0
You should officially support Windows Template Library (WTL) and make it the first class native Windows API framework replacing the aging MFC.,1
Please release compiler SDK and tools for developing traditional desktop Windows API (and MFC and .net) application on ARM Windows RT devices.,1
This capability is needed for third party apps also.,0
Now since Cortana does this already please pass us the parsed NLP string with identified pronouns with grammatical breakdown.,1
All localization should work like .resw files work - if there is no entry in the app description you should revert to the original entry.,1
It would be great if windows phone will support access to contact´s groups.,1
Allow a frame by frame capture from MediaCapture so that developers can more easily create streaming protocols without having to relay on the ugly and poorly documented Media Foundation API for trivial tasks.,1
I had unlucky case that my app was refused by the tester though on his screenshot you can see that he got exact message on why the app is not working as it required proper text to speech to be installed.,0
Bring back support for IPX/SPX or at the very least provide compatible drivers (either through the Microsoft Website or as a legacy feature) that can be installed on Windows 10.,1
Currently need to generate a bitmap image which not works well for list etc,0
Additional Payment option such as paypal should be added to allow people who owns visa card with advance features t register for Dev Center.,1
Everything works well The button is visible and it says Choose File however if you click the button nothing happens.,0
Please vote here to enable photo upload option in webview apps for windows phone,0
Suggestion: Introduce a system with trusted developers who can release apps as quick and easy as it is now.,1
Please create properties for disable Scrolling Pan and Zoom and Auto ressizing the webview.,1
Id like to see Windows APIs Command Prompts File Explorer support a much longer file path.,1
I feel that it is important to be able to minimize the CommandBar in Windows Phone apps because there is limited screenspace so even something like the CommandBar can make a difference.,1
I like the ability for apps to connect to the people hub and show items in the news feed but there are some things that are really annoying to consumers and could be solved with a few APIs.,1
I suggest some APIs for the app to attach some actions or commands to the item that the user can invoke straight from the people hub.,1
It is cool that the Facebook app can show my news feed in the people hub but its annoying the fact I have to go to the Facebook app to do something.,0
I suggest some APIs for the app to attach some actions or commands to the item that the user can invoke straight from the… more,1
We need a background task system event to update the wide tile (and the lock screen) message when the device wakes up (the lock screen becomes visible) on Windows Phone 8.1 (universal apps).,1
Visual Studio should allow built-in GPU Programming for major brands (NVidia AMD and Intel),1
I think the credentials needs to be deleted with the app uninstall.,1

Please extend this to be the Maximum time that the Bluetooth spec allows between pings to maintain a connection (which is 32 seconds) or atleast make it greater than 6 seconds so that very low power Bluetooth devices can be made.,1
Microsoft should include a good UI for the dashboard and to make some arrangement to display total downloads in the main page.like that of google Android dashboardthe windows developer dashboard is simply boring stuff,1
Id love to have better and improved reports to improve my app and tune the descriptions of my app store listings (ASO).,1
For this I hope you could add the uninstall rate usage (how often how long a user uses my app) etc.,1
Either allow to set a different password or remove the password of it like it was before in WP8.0.,1
Show download percentage,1
Please add a feature allowing developers to know the amount of remaining submission credits.,1
It would also be nice if we could request those credits from the dev.center,1
I also suggest that voice to text be allowed to write this,1
There should be a Windows tool to convert android xliff strings to .resx format within the Windows phone sdk with support for mcc codes,1
Enable Cortana on WP8.1,1
Press the search key and enter Cortanas notebook by pressing the icon in the upper left corner of the screen.,0
Allow more specific queries on Appointments.,1
Platform should support new applications that are not big companies.,1
Also Id like the rating of the app to allow me as the developer to respond back to the end user (ideally emailing them and or posting it online) And allow them to correspond with me to try and resolve any issues (whether that is with Microsoft being a proxy or whatever makes sense).,1
I suggest to create another option that alternates lost of signal and bad signal.,1
Create an infinite loop that breakes the connection in a random time.,1
A an ability to the emulator that can emulate a bad data connection so we can discover performance problems before our clients receive it.,1
Well I think that the devcenter app should be updated/extended so that the app can show the windows store apps as well as the phone apps (which it currently does) Ideally it should also use the live tiles to show the current stats on your apps.,1
Suggestion: Show exactly that error message in the Windows Store dashboard.,1
A single line should go through all the months regardless of the release or at least we should be able to turn that filter on or off.,1
please send more information on app before removal of suspension.,1
I am asking whoever checks or tests it put more information of their findings rather than giving the developers generic policy numbers like 1.1 or 3.6.,1
When utilizing the File Picker and specifying one or more extensions the dialog that gets shown to the user should filter to these extensions not show everything but only have those items selectable.,1
Let people inherit from EasingFunctionBase because Microsoft you do not have infinite wisdom and the predefined list of easing functions you give everyone doesnt have the one I need.,1
Please expand your search range to at least the top 100-200 apps.,1
Please update the Windows SDK and Windows App Certification Kit to allow us to use Win32 PrefetchVirtualMemory function: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/hh780543(v=vs.85).aspx,1
I think that having and IAP price point of $0.49 could be wildly attractive to end users and get more purchases for developers.,1
Id like to be able to ping for nearby devices running an app using PeerfFinder but while the app is not in the foreground.,1
Would it be practical to make it so that a user could authorize proximity tracking in the background so that an app could utilize it?,1
make possible to add a range of list<mapicon> to make it faster and optimized,1
Provide computer vision APIs that would allow developers to get access to functions such as motion tracking facial/gesture/voice recognition egomotion structures from motion and object identification etc.,1
Pivot and panorama controls should have options to enable/disable wrapping.,1
Also the scroll viewer should have options to disable overscrolling effect.,1
Please cant we have an option in the WPAppManifest file to untick fast resume and allow WP8.1 apps to not run in fast resume mode just like in WP8?,1
Microsoft should provide a better beta program for developers and user like the one in android in which you dont have to download a separate app  you update the stable one to the beta in the store.,1
Allowing to prefetch an ad allow the developer to optimise his ad strategy.,1
It will be useful if we can set the reminder tone to vibrate so that not every reminder would beep when youre in a meeting.,1
At times you may want to set a reminder and let it vibrate in your pocket still giving only you a notification instead of beeping out loud when you dont want it to.,1
For one of our products we need to support NFC card reading/writing with existing devices and several types of cards (Mifare UL ULC Calypso Desfire maybe even more),1
VS2013 could create those folders in each project and bring in the classes (pages and user controls) from the original project.,1
Please add recent places to SuggestedStartLocation in FileOpenPicker API.,1
It would be much less frustrating for Windows/Windows Phone developers to have hints sent with the certification failed reports which make it easier to tackle obvious issues that arise because of the restrictions of Windows/ Windows Phone.,1
Please implement the HttpListener class so that we can run REST based controls (similar to Xbox Smartglass) for our own apps?,1
Let normal http:// URIs to be able to send notifications to the app using the window.external.notify and not only the https:// URIs.,1
Give the power to the developer to decide if a page is allowed to use the ScriptNotify event or not!,1
And my only wish is to format a DateTime like the user wants to see it.,1
Please give us ability to run background agent and collect name of the current application in foreground.,1
Could you please add programmiatic printing to the WinRT API?,1
Under WPF it is possible to initiate printing to the default printer by simply calling Print() on a properly configured PrintDocument object.,0
In order to print the guests must leave the tailored kiosk experience and interact with the local print dialog.,0
While this is possible with CompositionSurface i feel it is needed on the Image Control as well.,1
The Lockscreen text attribute should be separated out from Tile attributes.,1
Could you please have a report that includes the prices before the final payment?,1
We need more control over the device so childrens activities can be regulated.,1
Once your app activates this mode users will not be able to see notifications access other apps or return to the Home screen until your app exits the mode.,0
Make necessary conditions so that developers choose proper (representing application )high quality images as application symbols in store matching modern ui,1
It would be good if we can at least optionally reduce the speed of the emulator to better reproduce real world devices.,1
Technically everything went smoothly but when I tried to submit the update it required that I reserved a name.,0
Please provide access to Calendar API to customize the day styles basing upon requirement,1
Id like a way to access the deviceExtendedProperties specifically the ANID2 in a Windows Store App.,1
Everything is fine up until that point but if you want to serialize that class so that you can store it and load it directly instead of traversing the filesystem and opening up each file to read its ID3 tags every time you open the app (which can be a lot of unnecessary work especially for larger libraries) (or so you can send which book to play to an audio background task) you really dont have many options.,0
My proposal is an API out of StorageFolder to retrieve a StorageItem given a relative path from that StorageFolder.,1
My suggestion is that when a payment is being processed this should be indicated on the Financial report which include the expected date it will arrive and the exact amount being processed.,1
I would suggest you look into AdMob/AdSense reporting for inspiration as its very convenience and everything a developer want to know about payments is easily accessible.,1
It would be nice to have such an API in WinRT so we dont have to resort to native DirectX each time we need something more than a couple of shapes.,1
What I want is the ability to record those alongside system-provided ETW events so that I can see how my codes activity fits in with system behaviour.,1
I would like to have better access to Lockscreen so that I can completely customize it which includes how the time is displayed any custom content like photos or news wallpaper.,1
It should also allow a timer based updation.,1
Obviously there should probably be a PIN requirement for first use/set up trust but the NFC capabilities of the WP platform will never be fully realized until a simple tap can make something happen without user interference.,1
I think this is a bug because I think if the WriteableBitmap decides to update the PixelWidth and PixelHeight property it should also update the PixelBuffer or the data is inconsistent.,0
make multitasking a real thing like seeing a video or having a mini calc when browse some thing.,1
Live tiles are fine but we need a true way to make tiles more dynamic and that would be accomplished with a widget application template.,1
In a similar way to the new lock-screen apps allow developers to create an app that runs inside a tile of larger dimensions that then current pre-defined tile sizes.,1
The app should have full access to touch events on the tile so it can respond to them.,1
Allow apps to act as data sources for other apps.,1
Build on WCF to allow on-phone app-to-app communication.,1
Allow JSON and/or XML to pass data between apps.,1
Make apps request permission the first time they talk to a new app then let it happen in the background.,1

We need real Background Download Broker so we can have torrent or custom Download scenarios (some of them may not apply to specific form factor),1
We need Windows Phone to synchronize its clock via the internet.,1
Include an API to add remove deactivate tracking protection lists (TPL) to further drive down data usage enable selective protection against rogue sites tracking and just having a sense of control.,1
it is better if developers can start their app from background i mean one develops an app that has permission to start itself when it receives a notification.,1
I understand power consumption is a consideration but a more balanced middle ground like only allowing more intensive background tasks when the system is plugged in and/or giving users clear indications such activity is occurring (liek Android does in its notification bar) so that they know why battery life is being impacted would make the WinRT environment much more useful and in turn drive adoption.,1
It would be great for a permanently running app to have an API which notifies it when an update is available to notify when an update is forced to permit the app to check for an update easily and also to permit the app execute the update.,1
Would become even more useful if say i could share to reading list from chrome extension or mac desktop or iOs.,1
We need the PivotViewer control for WPF and WinRT please.,1
I think that a wise addition would be to create a Universal search platform that when enabled a single tap on the Search button will bring up only a search bar and with that the user would search for content inside the app (and by content Im talking specifically for app content).,1
If I use this XAML definition it work but the groupheader is not wide as the listview.,0
With MaxNumberOfColums you can limit the number of columns.,0
Win8 applications need to be more productive for businesses!,0
Allow XAML winRT apps to change the lock screen background.,1
It would be much more comfortable to be able to read the entire notification in the center of notifications for wp8.1,1
Be responsible and give more & specific details why an app failed rather than pointing a policies which talks about several things.,1
As with CSS it would be very useful if we could set text based framework elements to be UPPERCASE lowercase Title Case etc with a TextTransform property in Xaml.,1
Please remove that validation or validate according with my tax plan and not my country in the account.,1
The point is to make the app universal across devices so that our engineers do not have to spend too much time learning and relearning the controls.,1
Please allow windows phone 8.1 file/folder picker to have access to onedrive and store the location in futureaccesslist.,1
Also please allow onedrive folder to be stored locally like winrt.,1
Because of windows 8.1 and windows phone 8.1 universal app I am hoping to adapt the app to windows phone as well.,1
Make SD boot fresh each time phone is restarted or double files with nothing in them to play then error 80070057,1
Prompt all users with a warning that they should make sure that the VPN is disabled before proceeding... including most users who have not enabled a VPN in the first place... and popping such a message almost every time the app is launched.,1
Re-write large portions of code as native code and use the Winsock APIs instead of the WinRT.,1
Make Bing Vision lens in the camera app pinnable to Start for quick access again and/or add it to the Cortana screen to the left of the Music Search button perhaps.,1
Please add the From To options right after Download new email under each email account to specify when the phone is allowed to check emails.,1
The Online Media extensibility is fantastic however it would be better if you allowed more sorting abilities for albums pictures and videos.,1
It would be good if there was more sorting (either via the photo hub or via code) which allows all items to be sorted titlecreation timestamplast updated timestamp ascendingdescending.,1
Pleas allow in the WMappmanifest a selection box to force legacy resume mode so my WP81 app can function just as it did in WP8.,1
However there should be more of swipe gestures than the tap methods.,1
To set a difference a swipe to the right should launch settings menu as a swipe to the left launches the apps list.,1
Plesae implement Windows.ApplicationModel.SuspendingDeferral as IDisposable (probably already declared in ISuspendingDeferral) and call method Complete() from within IDisposable.Dispose() to simplify its usage:,1
Hey I thought it would be really useful if users could add a homepage to their Internet Explorer for their WP like they would on a desktop/PC,1
IM apps could have custom keyboards or more fun ways of inputting data could be used.,1
For security reasons Id really like to see an option that if the high quality backup via wifi is enabled and if the phone is not currently connected to wifi then the phone automatically creates resized (smaller) photo and uploads it via data to the cloud and then deletes the resized photo from the phone.,1
When you connect an iPhone to a mac you can view the webview from Safari by going to Develop->Debug.,0
With frameworks like Angular Node jQuery etc becoming more popular we really need means to debug our apps to provide the best web experience.,1
I would like to be able to pull in Bing news search results for a specified keyword,1
Android has third-party apps that can block your apps/games with a password.,0
I would like to get Short videos in fullscreen instead of picture on Lockscreen.,1
I hope you like the idea i bet many people would like to have spinning earthwind blowingriver streamingwaterfallsetc on their lockscreen.,1
Therefore if you want to detect horizontal swipe manipulations in a Vertical scrolling ScrollViewer (for a custom ListView Item horizontal sliding animation implementation for example) it simply cannot be done.,0
In my opinion it is essential to have true multi-touch support for standard controls at least in Universal Applications.,1
Please extend Song Class with more useful properties such as LastPlayedDate AddedDate.,1
But why not allow it to be used locally by sideloading or through the emulators?,1
It would be great if you would add a RemoteId to the calendars.,1
I think there should be a casual genre section as a lot of apps dont fall into any specific section already listed.,1
For example timer and alarm apps.,0
It would be nice if more recent reviews would have more weight in the total score of the app.,1
please make bookmarks for podcasts persistent after moving to another podcast and coming back.,1
It would be nice to be able to render XAML that is not on the visual tree and perhaps in a background task.,1
We should be able to use descriptive text overlays in our screenshots it allows us to better point out what the screenshot is showing.,1
For some reason entering a number with a * at the front in to the dialler task in an app in WP7.5 WP8.0 or WP8.1 results in the message Please enter service codes directly from the phones keypad.,0
It would be helpful to be able to launch the calendar for a specific day i.e I tell the user you have x appointments today - Would you like to review them ?,1
It would be cool to allow the ApplicationBar to have more icons available.,1
It would be also cool to allow for more than one application bar per page so you could specify one at the top left bottom or right.,1
When will the alarm feature be implemented in winrt to support the phone?,1
It would be greater if we could disable the close function while doing important tasks like writing to the storage or similar.,1
Please enable removing language code from the Dev Center language history,1
It should be an option to remove the ru language code from my app language History or an option to completly replace: Fully replace the prevoius(es) xap(s).,1
Getting the Geolocator to actually do something requires getting the magical (and undocumented) setting of properties correct and then attaching event handlers,0
It would be extremely helpful if the reminder/alarm API supported creating a reminder for specific days of the week.,1
The trial feature should be built-in with automatic enforcement user prompting disabling etc just as it is in the Windows Store.,1
Contrast this with the Windows Phone world where the developer indicates trial mode in the store but has to manually track the number of days since install whether the user has purchased etc.,0
When submitting an app the store submission process should prompt you to link to documentation for any URI schemes your app includes in the manifest file or mark them as private URIs if you dont want to document them.,1
Currently the best place to find documentation for URI schemes is the Nokia Dev Wiki http://bit.ly/NokiaUriSchemes but this information should really be available though Microsoft.,1
Above could save hours spent on reading wrong answers,0
There need to be a business app settings launcher native in the API.,1
There must be a way to handle this kind of problem like statistics on how many times an app was started or not being able to start applications other than some basic apps.,1
There should be a property on the WebView that controls the fullscreen behavior such that it is possible to fill the entire viewable area of the display with the video and its controls.,1
Have an API for an application to interact with and listen for incomming connections from paired bluetooth devices while in background.,1
It will be very useful if user can scan custom QR code from other screen or poster from phone Search / Vision function and launch app via associated URI saved in QR code.,1
An HTTP-based API with a program-friendly logon (e. g. OAuth) would be most welcome.,1
There is no good reason for not allowing this so please add it.,0
Everyone in the USA has nice upload speeds possibly but not worldwide and I presume Microsoft would wish to enable developers from other countries also to be able to use their dev center.,0
Just remove the timeouts completely or at least increase all timeouts by a factor of at least 5 - its not a big deal to implement.,1
To go 1 step further making the support email process anonymous would probably convince more people to use the support system.,1
Set up a brokerage system whereby the developer never sees the users live email address and instead replies to a proxy email set up per-user.,1
Trial feature should be built-in with auto-prompted and disabling just like the Windows Store.,1
is it possible to create a traffic counter that can show how many traffic I have by wifi or by gms (lte).,1
the reminder function in the wp8 calendar must be expand to more weekly options.,1
Similarly this idea could be thought through for integration of One Note with other Native applications like Camera Messaging etc,1
It would be very useful to be able to prepair a MMSComposeTask in the same way that we today could use the SMSComposeTask .,1
We would like to create an app to monitor the time users spend in other the apps enabling enterprise customers to optimize a users day by analyzing time on applications.,0
I would like to have an option for each SkyDrive folder to make them available offline.,1
So those folders could be downloaded completely to the phone when a Wi-Fi is available to access them offline later.,0
Windows should allow additional user accounts added to track & review the application review process similar to what Apple and Android apple stores allow.,1
Please to have competitive advantage i would like you to provide an expedite package for app certification for developers who wants their apps to be published fast.,1
Having users enroll their phone using the same mdm client no matter the vendor is a nice idea.,1
Can we have an API to enroll the device through an app or allow mdm enrollment to initiate through a browser download.,1
As a developer I would like to have method to defer app deactivation/suspending in order to call async methods easily,1
If you are concerned about security reasons a good implementation of this API would be to always notify the user that a message from that application has been sent and where it was sent.,1
We now need to add extra code to reposition it at the top after it has been loaded.,0
Id suggest to include all Transactions in the Report.,1
All uesr want to find fast their contact when they must call so its very good to insert the fast search on phone dialer its good that the user can choose the better method to search like name or/and surname or/and Address etc...,1
i think its good that 3th apps can access to the list of installed apps and can decide to unistall or freeze or lock etc...,0
Allow downloading of submissioned .xap files in Windows Phone application publish submission process.,1
Please make kids corner as a another account.,1
At least remove password for kidscorner or make another password for kidscorner.,1
Allow debit cards as a payment instrument for registration and renewals,1
Would be great to discover Service Hosts in local Networks.,1
Provide an automation toolkit to enable developers to walk through a series of steps and take screenshots at relevant points then re-run those steps in different languages to automate the process of taking screenshots in different languages for app submission.,1
Would also be helpful in its own right for general localization testing to verify that localized strings have messed up layout.,1
As a developer the only way to increase app ratings and review is to prompt user.,0
I was expecting some notification center on the site so that i can see what new things have happened over my account since my last visit.,1
Let me be able to see the reviews that are added or app crashes so that my attention towards them grows infinitely large.,1
I want in WP8 back (it stiill works in WP7) that I can set a color for ApplicationBar Icons.,1
isnt it better to allow developers to change their app name inside app store according to different language and culture?,1
This would be very useful in the resource constrained environment of a phone.,0
Allow more code to be shared across platforms and,1
I would also be nice to be able to retain some kind of unique key the app could store or some other way the app can have a way to query to-do items that the app created.,1
A shared key chain to share data between the apps this help in apps with features like SSO,1
Include support for pen input like on the surface pro and surface pro 2 for both WP8 and RT,1
Make it possible to optionally declare a function OnClick() for live tiles such that this code is executed when the live tiles is presed without leaving the home screen.,1
Allow the phone to be used as a mini presentation device.,1
This can allow the phone to be used as a secondary display or project the screen contents on for example Push2TV devices or Widi Receivers,0
Please Make it possible to build WP7 / 7.5 Apps :(,1
The app should have more advanced options for scheduling when and how often it will run in the background perhaps by setting a different interval for different days of the week or times of the day or by specifying the time until it will run again each time it runs.,1
Users should be given insight into how often an application is running in the background so they can decide which applications are worth allowing to process in the background and which arent.,1
Furthermore the 25 second duration should be expanded to at least 60 seconds to account for larger data transfers and slower network connections.,1
This is also a capability that other mobile platforms have and I think it is needed to build quality apps with a good user experience.,0
Apps should get at least 60 seconds of background processing time to complete such network transfers and process the response.,1
In my opinion Chinese app are mainly design for Chinese and handsets are mostly from China Market.. Its may be challenging for developers to get phones from different countries or regions.,0
Having said these I propose such feature of prompting to do a language pack installation to be on the Windows Phone OS level when user switches language.,1
Having said these i thought a feature for prompting user installing language pack done on phone OS level would be good.,1
Provide access to Playlist API to be able to create (auto) playlists based on the song library on the phone.,1
If we use diferent datatemplates why not make every panel virtualizable?,1
For example I would love it if my GPS app could turn location on when the app starts and turn it back off when the app exits.,1
An developer should have an option or tool to manage that list and select which ones are displayed.,1
Under this suggestion the developer should be unable to manage or modify the base/standard images this suggestion is only for adding additional images.,1
The Windows Phone emulator should include the ability to manage VM snapshots for Windows Phone images.,1
If you want to load content after you reach the end of a list you have to write your own user control or create data bindings.,0
If NavigationService.Navigate() would let us pass a parameter of type object along with the URI it will help us to keep less states objects in the App class which will become a mess as project grows.,1
Please provide a PhotoCropTask that takes an Image(Byte[]) and provides the same crop tool.,1
Include a PixelHeight and PixelWidth as optional parameters so an aspect ratio can be included.,1
This would allow for Picture cropping.,0
Provide an API(s) that allow apps to either control Settings (eg being able to toggle WiFi when NFC tag is interacted).,1
Also it would be nice if there was an API that allowed an app to be integrated into the Settings Applets instead of a standard app.,1
Id like to see the Windows App store be similar to Google where I can skip the hassle and headache of certification and just get an app on the store in hours not days.,1
Allow us developers to renew our expired subscriptions.,1
Ive asked the support they said me that I have to create another subscription with another live account and after it ask them to migrate apps and related data.,0
Its not healthy to keep several accounts that means nothing specially ones that you just had to create because you need to renew the subscription,0
Please provide any idea about background service in wm8 as gps tracking automatically.,1
If Windows Phone as any faith in its future it needs a lot more support from the development team.,0
If you want people to develop apps you need to offer a dev platform that doesnt only run on the latest and greatest machines.,1
We miss a control like the integrated photo viewer to show photos or any controls page by page by using flick gestures.,1
It should be an option to remove the ru language code from my app language History.,1
You can publish an update with the removed ru language but this update will not fully replace the old version and you will in truble.,0
I think Placement should be splitted in HorizontalPlacement (Left Center Right) and VerticalPlacement (Top Bottom) to have more flexibility.,1
I would like to have a reminder system (API) that allows me to know if the phone is near a phone from a friend (location based).,1
Example: Remind me to ask Holly about the project status when I meet her the next time.,0
I think this will be the wrong way.,0
I am a professional software engineer and I am developing with Visual Studio at work So I thougt its a goot idea to buy a windows phone because I could develop some phone applications.,0
It would be very convenient to just click a button and have your app placed in only the markets that we do not need to worry about taxes.,1
Since changing is not an option you will need to create a new account within the Turkey region.,0
Since you have mentioned that you are a student account this might require you to create to simultaneous accounts.,0
Note that if you have a Store account the apps from that side will not transfer.,0
It would be great if there were specific classes that could be instantiated on non-ui threads (and then loaded by ui-thread image objects),1
This would be very useful in determining why sometimes upload is slow,0
Mark sideloaded apps in app list so one can differentiate an in-store app from a side loaded version thats in development.,1

I know that text boxes can be customized easily.,0
But the UWP textboxes are not that god when it comes to numeric input.,0
Im currently working on a software that has a lot of numeric input.,0
Only allows numeric input,0
Format numbers with commas on thousands (i.e.,0

Comparison results with Edge on the right:,0
App tested is WebView Release.,0
Tried both WebViewExecutionMode.SeparateThread,0
Even rendering on separate thread will block UI thread (for example Reveal highlight effect while bigger page is loading or typing into TextBox will lag while javascript in the page is running),0
Currently it is impossible to implement context menus save files and implement other functions general web browsers have.,0
Every modern operating system on this planet uses LF style line endings except for Windows which still writes one more useless byte at every end of a line.,0
It is time for a change!,0
What can i do?,0
My Windows is Version 1709 Build 16299.19.,0
Something in both Silverlight and WPF but missing from UWP - Tiled brushes!,0
(Although curiously TileBrush is still the base class for brushes... just without tiling :( ),0
This will allow use of tiled images (and perhaps videos) for use as brushes anywhere a XAML Brush is accepted - like Backgrounds Text foregrounds Path fills etc.,0
I want my UWP UI to look the same across any screen of the same resolution regardless of the scale factor applied by Windows.,0
For instance when running my app on the Hololens it applies a 150% scale factor.,0
This means the UI looks squished when compare to a desktop screen of a similar resolution (1280x720).,0
Can this be implemented for the Hololens?,0
There are situations where you might want to interrupt navigating away from a page when using NavigationView.,0
Say you throw up a message box a la Do you want to save the changes Yes/No/Cancel if you were to click Cancel theres no way to prevent the NavigationView to follow through with it visually.,0
Say you have two menu items one Home and the other Whatever.,0
Theres no sane way to do it e.g.,0
a Cancel boolean on the event args of the ItemInvoked event.,0
An example for this would be this budgeting app Im currently working on.,0
If youre editing a transaction but havent committed it trying to navigate away Id like to throw up a Save Changes?,0
message box with the typical Yes/No/Cancel options.,0
I cant deal with the Cancel action without code voodoo trying to revert the SelectedItem ASAP.,0
Thanks for considering changing this.,0
In my opinion UWP is too much APP centric.,0
We are spending (and loosing) a great amount of time working around trying to do simple things (like pass command line arguments.. write on folders .. trying to execute another program ..).,0
OS information is not included at all on the Usage page.,0
While I get crashes by OS (Health page) I need to cross-reference this with usage by OS to determine the overall impact of a given bug.,0
We are currently developing for desktop-only screens (we have control over the device types) and want to prevent users from sizing the window smaller than 992px x 700px.,0
This application is far too complex for mobile screens and 500 x 500 is too small.,0
Is this an option we can hope for in the near future?,0
The default MenuFlyoutSubItem allows you to add subitems either through XAML or the Items code behind property.,0
Im currently trying to convert an application that contains some of the CoreUtils utilities (most notably [.exe and ].exe).,0
Looking at the VfsOps.ps1 file it seems that the Test-Path on line 138 assumes that the file path is a standard wildcard not a file name.,0
Looks like it could be fixed by adding [Management.Automation.WildcardPattern]::Escape(...) somewhere but I havent been able to find out how to make the catalog writeable so that I can test this...,0
When running through C++ Code Analysis projects using ATL will minimally hit the following atlcom.h warnings:,0

Orbit View Currently have 2D plane so for Mixed Reality Apps third Dimension needed to expand it functionality.,0
Like for example for Space apps where Earth have satellites NEO and space stations and they all have orbits based on earth so orbital view in 3D make it better in Mixed reality,0
Is there some sort of bug tracker for Microsoft software?,0
Kinda like UserVoice but for bug reports?,0
I have an app that works normally but when launched via the Desktop Bridge theres some strange issues with COM.,0
What does the Desktop Bridge do differently?,0
CoreApplication now has a RequestRestartAsync method but it fails in a Desktop Bridge app with NotInForeground.,0
I wonder if this is because of the way the Desktop Bridge technology wraps the WPF application.,0
Any ideas on how I can cause the app to restart?,0
However collapsing a pivot item does not remove it from the UI visual tree.,0
The header still exists and is keyboard focus-able.,0
Since you can correctly hide ListBoxItems Im considering this a bug.,0
Repository on github: https://github.com/tesar-tech/MediaPlayerFrameMoveInconsistentBehavior,0
At first this isnt an issue since the control isnt Visible.,0
However if you make the parent visible binding will not be triggered and you must manually force an update to get bound values to appear.,0
Otherwise yet again MVVM is broken.,0
I have a UWP UserControl line chart that renders a PathFigure to a Canvas.,0
This chart supports zooming and the PathFigure size is changed during zoom but clipped within the visible Chart area.,0
At high zoom levels (above 300%) the entire UWP app will crash with a native exception: An unhandled win32 exception occured in <app> [17800],0
There must be a bug some place in the framework.,0
This crash only happens using the Fall Creators Update after the clipping issue was fixed.,0
Im guessing its a numerical overflow somewhere deep in the graphics stack.,0
From my viewpoint I think there is no way in managed code I should be getting a native exception like this.,0
The following Hyper-V networking Configuration breaks DNS name resolution on the Virtual Machine:,0
Connecting the host to a non-corporate (remote) WiFi network.,0
When a VM is connected to the default switch and the host is connected to the corporate network via Cisco AnyConnect the VM looses the ability to resolve DNS addresses.,0
This issue was submitted as a MS Premier support ticket (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/commercial/incidents/117111417156306) and a Connect bug (https://connect.microsoft.com/WindowsServer/feedback/details/3142497/build-16299-15-hyper-v-default-switch-nat-name-resolution-not-working).,0
Was advised by Premier that this is an architectural issue.,0
Start a VM and connect it to the Default Switch (NAT),0
Using the fall creators update version of UWP it seems that when a data context is changed to a new view model the previous view model is updated with null values.,0
This is the same as if the DataContext is set to null before changing view models.,0
It doesnt make sense why the bound values are updated when the DataContext is changed.,0
In stack overflow or any other forums we have option to add multiple tags related to our question.,0
Currently is not possibile to create a new Calendar inside an Enterprise Exchange user account.,0
Its only allowed to create an app calendar which lives on local device,0
The Windows.Services.Store namespace does not provide a class that you can use to simulate license info during testing.,0
At the moment a VSTO add-in cannot be published on Windows Store or on Office Store.,0
An idea could be extending Desktop App Converter tool in order to manage VSTO add-in.,1
However when using the result in a Drag+Drop or Clipboard operation Windows Explorer errors out with 0x80004002 No such interface supported.,0
It can be used between UWP apps but not in Windows Explorer which really is a shame.,0
There are desktop Win32 APIs for delay creation of files that are used heavily e.g.,0
in WinZIP and similar applications to delay actual unzip of files until really required but they cannot be used in UWP.,0
Please support the UWP equivalent called CreateStreamedFileAsync in Windows Explorer!,1
Things like MinConnectionInterval MaxConnectionInterval SlaveLatency and Connection Supervisory Timeout,0
It is a compendium of various PDF viewer tutorials rolled into a single user control.,0
I have no doubt it could be improved by community involvement.,0
The documentation may be found here:,0
An given example of the API can be seen below:,0
Under UWP it is still not possible to open a folder or file out of the sandbox.,0
Even to suggest a path is not possible.,0
So your are not able to suggest a folder or file to the user by a path-string.,0
So at the moment i have to tell my customers: open the folder-picker and navigate from the pictures-library to the path:D:very long path..final_folder.,0
and thereby... the folderpicker has no preview to the content in a folder.,0
actual implementing an selection of file or folder in UWP (how easy but stupid),0
so picker.SuggestedStartLocation is not a string to a path but only a selection of libraries.,0
does microsoft really believe that users and developers accept that lowest budget setup?,0
now after the great Windows 10 Fall Creators Update it is still a joke to switch and develop to UWP.,0
does anybody at MS have an idea how to propose an path in an UWP application?,0
Well currently I have a Uwp app that needs to call a web.api service that is secured with azure ad.,0
I have been looking for samples and tutorials to do this and I have found some.,0
But they all differ in what to do exactly.,0
I have created AppPinManager helper class  just call those helper fuunction  it will takecare to add into the startmenu or TaskBar,0
For example a long running task where the user is not allowed to back out until it completes.,0
Currently UWP Community Toolkit includes seven services that are very useful but more is always better it would be awesome to add more and more services including a big one for a lot of people WordPress.,1
To clarify that this can be done from Windows 10 as a part of Windows administration and configuration for instance via Group Policies PowerShell Windows Updates Schedule Tasks etc.,0
There are several issues with the file activation NeighboringFilesQuery argument and the file system indexer.,0
If files are loaded using the NeighboringFilesQuery then GetPropertiesAsync on those files will only return properties that have been indexed.,0
This prevents reading things like altitude from the GPS location data.,0
The above is made a lot worse on computers where indexing file content is disabled (right click on the drive in Explorer select properties and see check box at the bottom) which used to be recommended for SSD drives.,0
In particular no ImageProperties are available in this case.,0
It also happens if the indexer isnt working properly (which is not uncommon).,0
If the indexer is really broken (for some reason this started happening on my PC so is not uncommon) then it will fail to pick up any neighboring files at all (confirmed by using the default Photos app to open a photo in a folder with lots of photos and it only showed one photo).,0
I dont think this is a security issue because the data is in the file and the file contents are readable.,0
This will enable automatic testing on hybrid windows apps where DOM inspection is necessary.,0
When setting ToolTipService.Placement to Mouse the text in the tooltip is no longer sharp.,0
It looks like the tooltip is not perfectly aligned to the device pixels but rather half a pixel off vertically.,0
This is on Windows 10 Fall Creators Update (build 16299.19) @ 150% DPI scale the app targets Windows 10 SDK 16299.,0
Would be a lot more intuitive useful and less distractive then the current overlay.,0
Imagine writing text directly into the TextBox or RichEditBox canvas without the Ink-Keyboard-Overlay.,1
It limits the use case of MasterView.,0
We cant use Pivot Semantic Zoom GridView PullToRefresh SlidableListItem and more.,0
Dont fake the page navigation using Storyboard.,0
Then devs can use Connected Animations.,0
I upgraded to the latest VS 2017 and change my UWP app to use .Net.Native 2.0.,0
It now gets a number of linker problems that are being caused by Microsoft components.,0
Calling this method would throw exception at runtime.,0
If for some reason your P/Invoke does not satisfy those requirements please use [DllImport(ExactSpelling=true) to indicate that you understand the implications of using non-UWP APIs,1
I dont call this function.,0
When I traced down some new crashes I found that Socket.ConnectAsync is trying to call this function and failing because it doesnt exist.,0
I have about 15-20 similar errors in the build that are referencing things I dont directly call.,0
Ive reverted to .Net.Native 1.7 until this gets fixed.,0
In Windows Forms toolkit there is a handy control called the NumericUpDownControl.,0
Current appextension only supports loading assets and scripts.,1
In many scenarios 3rd party author may provide some code actable with the main app for example decoding another file format.,1
There may be trusting problems.,0
If you change the DataPackageOperation to Copy the problem goes away.,0
We are experiencing an issue where the presence of a PasswordBox with a NumericPin InputScope overrides the InputScope of other controls on the page--until the PasswordBox has received focus.,0
On a touch screen this manifests every time a user reaches the first page in our UWP App that has a NumericPin-scoped PasswordBox.,0
Build and run the app,0
See that the touch keyboard is the NumericPin keyboard even though the focused TextBox should have the default InputScope.,0
Click into TextBox 2.,0
Keyboard remains NumericPin.,0
See that the InputScopes of the TextBoxes are now honored.,0
Before doing anything else click the Show touch keyboard button in the notification tray such that the touch keyboard appears.,0
I think I found a problem in Media Player.,0
The problem happens on phone if media player is paused from another media app.,0
In this case will be fired only MediaPlayer.PlaybackSession.PlaybackStateChanged event and it is not possible to detect whether app was paused through user or system.,0
But if phone calls then will be simulated SystemMediaTransportControls pause button click (MediaPlayer.SystemMediaTransportControls.ButtonPressed event) and on phone call I can correctly stop my player and change some states.,0
I am preloading images for speed and I need to release the memory immediately when no longer needed to prevent memory failures but setting the reference to null and even calling GC.Collect() immediately does not always result in an immediate release of memory.,0
Ive looked into using a SoftwareBitmapSource instead but this is a lot slower and uses more memory and Im not 100% sure whether its Dispose method works (doesnt affect memory shown in VS debugger but did seem to have an effect when testing using a mobile emulator).,0
Compact overlay window is always shown at the right-top corner.,0
Conditional check doesnt actually solve the problem it doesnt suit the control like NavigationView since at the end developer still have to create a NavigationView with SplitView which is really pain to maintain.,0
More details can be found in this issue https://github.com/Microsoft/WindowsUIDevLabs/issues/150,0
We can see the support of communities in UWPCommunityToolkit.,0
As a self-learner it is very hard to find a tutorial to learn new things.,0
MapControl has some nice extensibility options but requires specifying a token even if youre using local or custom tile sources as the background replacement layer.,0
I hear a lot about “clean uninstall” but we noticed a few months ago appx leaves some stuff behind.,0
Specifically persisted appframe window sizing data remains behind potentially leaving the user/dev in a potential bad or confusing window state.,0
See the data piling up in the following stores:,0
A lot of small time developers like myself dont have the means to use the Microsoft Store to host their apps.,0
I develop applications for the military and the IT department barely has any idea what theyre doing.,0
Win32 apps still dominate because theyre so robust and developed.,0
To bring in new and old developers bring back the same functionality that is found in WPF and Winforms.,0
Assume the following XAML: and not calling SetDesiredBounds!,0
This is what the screen looks like: https://1drv.ms/i/s!AqT0PAFUIw04htwcFjitFI7iNTXl5A,0
(sorry for the photo could not do a regular screen shot at the moment!),0
Looks good?,0
Yes video and transport controls cover the entire media player!,0
In full screen transport controls (not video) do also respect the safe area.,0
Otherwise this looks cut and incomplete.,0
Nevertheless so far this is ok and could be called as expected.,0
So far so good.,0
Now lets turn on DesiredBoundsMode.,0
The safe area is removed... and it looks like the following: https://1drv.ms/i/s!AqT0PAFUIw04htwdhtSgx38PFkcWeQ,0
Page has no more safe area BUT on the transport controls have suddenly the safe area even though the media player is part WITHIN the page.,0
(For full screen it remains the same framed version as before so no additional screen shot) Why are transport controls no longer covering the entire video?,0
Thats an real issue.,0
I am removing the safe area by calling SetDesiredBounds and I am experiencing framed transport controls then even when using as control somewhere within the page.,0
I debugged this a lot and found a solution (and realized a very dirty hack by Microsoft):,0
In my app I am using custom transport controls and I used the original template as a starting point.,0
I found out that there is a <grid> element with x:name=ControlPanelGrid and on Xbox it gets magically a margin of 4804827,0
This is documented nowhere and has the bad effect described above.,0
Removing the x:name or renaming that element is enough the margin is gone.,0
Nevertheless I would expect a less hacky solution.,0
Having a safe-area within a media elements transport controls when not full-screen is definitely a bug.,0
And fiddling arround with a grid by name is just a dirty hack since this does not work with custom transport controls as long as the magic grid with its name is not present.,0
The MediaPlayerElement supports various subtitle formats.,0
But when we play a video file using MediaStreamSource it is not possible to pass through the subtitle streams because we cannot create MediaStreamDescriptors for them.,0
So audio and video works but subtitles dont work.,0
This would be very helpful to make the MS initiated FFmpegInterop truly unviersally useful.,0
I am unable to use containers and VmWare/VirtualBox on Windows 10 at the same time due to the restriction of Hyper-V.,0

Why does Hyper-V lock out other virtualization software?,0
The WPF UniformGrid (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.primitives.uniformgrid(v=vs.110).aspx) is missing in UWP.,0
It doesnt seem to quite have an equivalent in UWP in order to get even spacing of a grid automatically as well as other features like setting rows/columns and first column for calendar type applications.,0
We need this so we can directly start searches within Cortana from our apps.,0
1) Camera app using display as a flash to light-up when using front facing camera.,0
A previous uservoice API to control screen brightness https://wpdev.uservoice.com/forums/110705-universal-windows-platform/suggestions/2359006-api-to-control-screen-brightness was marked closed after Creators update with Brightness control being introduced.,0
BrightnessOverride would fit the purpose except it requires IoT / Embedded mode and therefore cannot use this API.,0
2) Clock app to control the brightness of display at night time,0
Apple announced support for Fragmented MP4 backed HLS Streams under HLS version 7: https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/504/ at WWDC 2016.,0
We are looking to change the way our HLS streams are generated and Windows seems to be one of the few platforms that doesnt support playing these type of streams.,0
I have to make a stub of the class in the local project which causes duplicate of code.,0
I submitted this to the VS forum but they said to post the issue here.,0
if the <DataTemplate x:DataType=models:LocalStatus> references POCO class that is in a seperate project the XAML will not compile.,0
We now have this option for ListView and GridView but not for the ComboBox control.,0
The StreamSocket class has no good way of polling the connection status without sending data (your connection may have died minutes ago but you wont know until you try to send something which isnt desirable).,0
Many of the old implementations in .Net and even in VB6 socket control had this functionality (and it was highly useful).,0
The proposal is to add something like:  // Something happened update your UI or run your business logic,1
While downloading a file with BackgroundDownloader the progress updates every 1MB which is not really accurate.,0
Ive noticed that pausing and resuming the download accelerates the update rate to about every 250 ms.,0
This would allow us to easily use different ItemTemplates for each group in conjunction with GroupStyleSelector.,0
There are many cases where you have different kind of data and group them by data type.,0
imagine a image viewer where you have one group Folders and one group Images.,0
Or you display search results for various item types in one view.,0
It is possiblte to achieve this right now using the normal ItemTemplateSelector on ListView/GridView.,0
But it causes a context switch from native->.net and back for each item which will slow down the control when showing a lot of items (this is noticeable on slow devices or phones).,0
Plus as I read in the docs this can degrade virtualization performace as the control does not know upfront which items need which template.,0
Now the control does not need to call selector for every item speeding up the control.,0
m writing this feedback in Desktop Bridge because I think this team is the innovative and will do a better job of communicating these problems to Windows Store team.,0
Desktop Bridge attracts me as a developer but Windows Store puts me off.,0
Currently the only way to find programs are if you type their names.,0
There are no keyword searches.,0
This has been like that for many years but no one has done anything about it.,0
If you wonder why developers are not jumping on to something as attractive as Desktop Bridge this is the reason.,0
There are many threads on Internet discussing this issue but Windows Store team doesnt seem to listen.,0
Otherwise the private store can only be used for in-house apps or free apps.,0
A content control that enables the user to use inking to enter text in TextBoxes (including RichEditBox),0
Each JavaScript app that uses a Video element in the UI and calls the play() function to stream the video preview from camera to the app page will Crash after recent Windows 10 update 10.0.15063.608,0
This crash occurs in all JavaScript apps that use the MediaCapture API to display camera Video previews.,0
For this reason apps programmed in JavaScript that use Video or photo capturing are from now on non-functional in Windows 10.,0
According to the documentation it is possible to x:Bind events to a handler.,0
When working with parameters this works as long as the parameters have the default names.,0
So for the CalendarView.SelectedDatesChanged event the following signature works:,0
This behavior is not found in public documentation.,0
But I couldnt find any option in my dev center account to support this functionality.,0
In DX11 you cant read and write to the same texture and thats fine I can live with that.,0
However the API was designed that it will introduce severe overhead in the following scenario.,0
These objects are semi-transparent (alpha-blending) so I need to draw them sorted by distance to camera (back to front) and not by state changes.,0
Lets assume I have 50 objects which are Soft Particles (SP),0
And 50 objects that are triangle meshes (TM),0
Both SP and TM use alpha blending.,0
SP dont do depth writes but they do depth-tests and depth reads in the shader.,0
TM do depth writes and depth tests but they dont do depth reads in the shader.,0
By depth writes I mean the D3D11_DEPTH_STENCIL_DESC.DepthWriteMask,0
So both SP and TM do legal operations (they dont write to the depth buffer and read in the shader at the same time),0
However in the worst case when SP and TM are ordered in the following way:,0
I have to change the depth stencil view using OMSetRenderTargets for each draw call to set the same depth texture but with view that has D3D11_DSV_READ_ONLY_DEPTH enabled or disabled.,0
So in order to draw them all I have to do:,0
To my understanding OMSetRenderTargets is a slow operation but I need to call it 100 times.,0
And the calls to OMSetRenderTargets are really useless because the same depth texture is used just with a different view and because both SP and TM do legal operations they dont write to the depth buffer and read in the shader at the same time.,0
I dont need to create 2 depth stencil views for each depth buffer (one with D3D11_DSV_READ_ONLY_DEPTH enabled and one with disabled),0
I dont need to call OMSetRenderTargets for each draw call where I want to change D3D11_DSV_READ_ONLY_DEPTH.,0
But I just stick to normal depth writes D3D11_DEPTH_STENCIL_DESC.DepthWriteMask,0
This artificial limitation is also the cause for bugs in WebGL 2 in Chrome/FireFox:,0
Once you start working on WebGL 2 in MS Edge you will notice that you will encounter the same problem because in GLES3/WebGL2 its legal to read from the depth texture while its bound to the FBO and you will have to do checks for each draw call if depth stencil view needs to be changed to have D3D11_DSV_READ_ONLY_DEPTH or no.,0
Say I have 100 objects to draw.,0
SP dont do depth writes but they do depth-tests… more,0
See GitHub issue for more information and scenarios (https://github.com/Microsoft/WindowsUIDevLabs/issues/239),0
its extremely annoying when I face service issues with devcenter with no knowledge if they are investigated or not.,0
I dont want all the time contact support wait wait wait and yeah we have issues or now is just Saturday...Ive to wait til Monday?,0

The main impediments when creating a Chat-like control using a ListView is that we dont have a native way to handle incrementalLoading at the top of list.,0
There is already an example we can reuse in UWP samples https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/tree/master/Samples/XamlBottomUpList,1
Wanted to use /list to work on automating the installer for a container image and theres a ****** check in place that blocks this scenario because the SDK is already installed.,0

The WebView control doesnt allow printing embedded PDFs etc.,0
If it works in Edge Chrome and Firefox it should work in WebView control.,0
Not sure why even having a web browser control if it isnt going to have full browser features (minus the tabs settings URL input box etc.,0
Since Edge doesnt support lockdown usage (like IE did with Kiosk mode) it makes it even more important to have this.,0
I add a CustomAudioEffect which is EQ (Ive also tried using official UWP samples EchoEffect) to MediaPlayer.,0
Although it seems CustomAudioEffect is running on Worker thread not UI thread it seems media playback would also be impact when UI loading a bit heavier.,0

Master-Detail with x:Bind is not working properly.,0
When you use x:Bind to bind a TextBox to a property of the SelectedItem of a ListView this problem exists:,0
2. you select a new item in the listView,0
Your changes from 1 are lost because the selection in the ListView changes before the LostFocus-event of the TextBox was raised.,0
That means the change was never written back to the original item.,0

Attempting to utilize the Windows UCRT SDK (...Windows Kits10Include10.0.15063.0ucrt) to evaluate Clang on Windows I was immediately facing an unexpected wall in the form of an undisclosed and unexpected dependency on Microsofts Visual Studio.,0
Apparently even the simplest C program will not be able to compile (as soon as you include any standard C header) because they all seem to end-up attempting to #include <vcruntime.h> (which is not part of the UCRT).,0
Is there a way to utilize the Windows Universal C RTL SDK withOUT Visual Studio?,0
If it is not intended why then is it not called Windows CRT for Microsoft VC - what am I missing and is it really legal/appropriate?,0

The Windows Store analytics API allows great access to acquisition data (both app and add-on acquisitions).,0
However being able to tie this data with revenue data is limited as transaction data can only be downloaded by CSV through the Payout Summary page.,0
The site Windows Dev Center (https://developer.microsoft.com) is *very* slow when navigating with Edge.,0
We are talking page load times of several minutes in many cases.,0
I have done troubleshooting with Windows developer support who knew about the issue and recommended using another browser like IE.,0
The site is faster in Chrome and IE but still not fast and gives a poor user experience due to the lack of performance.,0
Currently it is at risk of giving the impression of being neglected and not prioritized.,0
This is a control that I use quite frequently in my LoB applications which I can see being something that is used across other applications.,0
I have an implementation that Im more than happy to provide.,0

The Acquisitions Funnel in the new Windows Developer Center dashboard is cool but the rectangular bars representing each stage of the funnel are incorrect.,0

When adding (or removing) a lot of items we suspend the events and will raise a *single* event for all the items that were changed during the suspension period.,0
Before recent changes we were (ab)using the .Reset event type to inform the UI components that the collection has changed.,0
In the current version we have optimized the collection so it knows *exactly* what has changed in the suspension state.,0
We will only invoke the correct Add / Remove actions for all the items.,0
Unfortunately it looks like the UI components (in this case a ListBox) cannot deal with the .Add and *multiple items*.,0
This does not work:,0
The event args implementation correctly contains all the added items and the right indexes (all covered by unit tests).,0
For some notes on the investigation see https://github.com/Catel/Catel/issues/1066,0
I *think* this is a bug in the way the UI components deal with the NotifyCollectionChangedEventArgs instance.,0
If its add the components dont loop all the,0
I dont see this limitation documentated anywhere (but I might have missed it).,0
This makes the collection much faster to work with when making large changes.,0

When using a company Store account with associated developer accounts its presently not possible for the developers to raise support issues for Store problems.,0

WinAppDriver does not work with @WindowsFindBy annotation because AppiumFieldDecorator forces the GET /context command which is not supported by WinAppDriver.,0
I understand WinAppDriver does not currently support WebView and therefore it does not support context switching so /context command is not provided.,0
However the context switching is not required to support @WindowsFindBy annotated element.,0
Then Appium will happily use the native locator.,0
I can get the page source with current WinAppDriver and I see all the elements returned have the attributes for size (width height) or position(x y) but the values of those attribute are all zero.,0
I think this is the reason why Appium Inspector does not highlight the element position in the screenshot images when an element was selected in the App Source tree or clicking on the screenshot does not select the corresponding element in the App Source tree.,0

"(A third was scrapped because of the inability to do location tracking in a background task more frequently than once every 30 minutes, which is sort of the same 'stale data' issue as here.)",0
"Since it's user-initiated, it wouldn't drain_�_ more",0
"In the Schedule Namespace ist isn't possible to have access to the Media Library to play Songs, User has already on his Device -> Please add this function to get access to the Media Library.",1
"Another thing is, to have the possibility to modify the Notification, wich is shown, when the Alarm or Reminder Rings.",1
"We need to open our Application, or to overwrite the notify to costumize it to get a better improvement for the user.",0
"Extend the API to query phone volume and vibration settings, maybe even set them.",1
Please provide validation templates for WindowsPhone controls.,1
"However, not everybody has a physical device, so having those experiences in the emulator would be a great addition to the dev tools and resources.",1
"Would be nice and useful to have email messages grouped by date, same as contacts grouped by initial letter.",1
For sharing audio and video there should be a very plain possibility to share stuff as already encoded package.,1
Perhaps that could be available as Toolkit in codeplex.com.,1
There needs to be an Alpha Test mechanism available.,1
"Since the beta test versions I recently submitted have been waiting for certification for 9 days, there is no way for us to work together on this.",0
My boss is not a developer and has no development tools but absolutely needs to see the progress of development in a timely manner.,0
If the Beta program certified apps in a day then this might not be a problem.,0
"As it is, it is hardly usable as a beta test program since our customers also need to see the app and improvements in a timely manner.",0
"We need support special multitasking tasks, like VOIP and IM!",0
"We can't create good apps for this services without this API, looks on your Skype client, wtf??",0
iOS already has this API's!,0
"Volume on headphone, when phone rings while listening to a song, raise to max volume.",0
Multi-select on Zune to delete Albums or to create a playlist,0
"Read/write accsess to email sync settings could enable applications to create custom sync profiles (based on week-days, time, position, etc).",0
Implement Soundwave touchless api on the phone for touch free Metro.,1
Microsoft boffins showed how they can use audio via the speaker and microphone and a dopplar computation to detect gestures without touching the screen.,0
I want to use that on the Phone for some games.,0
"In the submission process, publishers should be able to check a box for apps that are made for individuals 13 or older and 18 or older.",1
"This should flag a feature in the marketplace, when an app is being downloaded, to verify the age of the downloader.",0
"In WP7 you can add multiple accounts of different types (Live, Google, Facebook, etc).",0
It would be nice to be allowed to get basic information about these accounts.,1
"For example, get a list of all email accounts and for each account report the number of unread emails.",0
I think there are two ways to improve the beta program: 1.,0
Make apps available immediately.,1
"When developing on iOS (using testflight) or Android, we don't have to wait two hours for beta code to be ""approved"".",0
We upload a new version or have the users download an update immediately.,0
"If immediate approval is not possible, then apps that have been published should be immediately available.",1
"When we receive emails saying the beta application is published, users are not able to download the application with the very own links provided in the email.",0
Users are reporting a 1-2 day time between when the app is approved to when it is available for download.,0
Users receive a strange marketplace error when trying to download the application.,0
When developing apps it is often useful to leverage existing Launchers and Choosers as Tasks to access certain data or perform an operation.,0
Currently this is only exposed for system-level data and operations.,0
It would be ideal to allow apps to expose certain bits of data or functionality to other apps to provide a complementary experience in terms of reuse of information or performing similar tasks.,1
Imagine shopping apps being able to share a set of data such as a wish list or news apps being able to share a list of news feeds.,0
"Imagine having an installed app do what it does best for another app, such as perform a series of complex calculations or gather weather data.",0
It would be the responsibility of the app to decide what it exposes for data or functionality.,0
This can first be alleviated as with other security screening by prompting the user to allow an app to access another app's tasking features.,1
"In such case, you'd better make your videos carefully so that it can leave a good user experience to the potential clients.",1
"If you convert video to FLV flash video, which features much smaller size than popular formats, your videos will be watched unhinderedly with quick loading.",1
select FLV as output format,0
"If you are more requirements of your video, such as bit rate, encoder, etc, you are do these settings one by one in the pop-up Formats window.",0
" When everything is finished, you can click Start button to start the video to FLV conversion process.",0
You are allowed to preview the converting process in slideshow.,0
"As 99% computer owners have installed flash plugin in web browser, so it's naturally that FLV or SWF flash videos are more acceptable than popular videos formats, such as MP4, AVI, MPEG or ect.",0
"If you convert video to FLV flash video, which features much smaller size than_�_ more",0
Allow the BackgroundAudioPlayer to play tracks from the MediaLibrary.,1
Or allow applications that implement the XNA MediaPlayer class to run in the background.,1
"Please add the possibility to add your own spell check service, or provide the data if a system wide one existed.",1
"When I want to build some tiles in my app, I have to use buttons that I give a custom style.",0
"But this is ugly since everyone implements this in another way, resulting in odd alignments, bad text colours, etc.",0
We need a simple and standardized way to create simple tiles that function as buttons.,1
Beta testers test our apps for free.,0
It would be nice if when the app/game is published in the marketplace we could include a list of the testers that helped us so they can get the app from free instead of having to buy it.,1
"Android,iOs and Blackberry are compatible with this API So why don't we",1
"I would be a really nice gesture to have an option wich can put everything to the other side, so when left handed people scroll, they could also see the content.",1
Visual Studio 11 and new Expression Blend.,0
Merge products together.,1
"Add 'open app in marketplace' in the app menu (rate & review, uninstall, pin to start)",1
It does not look professional when scrolling upward at the end of any page or downward at the top the content of the page regardless of material or application will be stretched down,0
It is part of the effect through the whole operating system and does not particularly belong to any application.,0
Sometime the stretched content of the page does not look professional.,0
We need UPD broadcast to search for our devices in the network.,1
"When an exception is thrown and intercepted by the debugger, Edit and Continue permits to change your code right while debugging to make the code continue.",0
We can allow music that is not copyrighted to be accessible if that is a huge issue.,1
"Link to sql is not efficient at all, could they include sql , sqlight or other library.",1
"It s impossible to connect easily to ftp network, I suggest to include it in the future sdk.",1
We want an Office Hub that open Openoffice document.,1
Currently for dynamic data binding controlls like listbox  is recommended.,1
Why can't I change phone search and IE search to Google or another provider that actually work?,1
Fix Bing or fix the phone.,1
"At best this is unclear, but should the user pan or zoom they lose the frame of reference for the place we're trying ot show them.",0
You can sometimes work around this behaviour by specifying a search for the place you're trying to indicate but this is dependent upon the search results.,0
If the search finds nothing you get no pin.,0
Or if the search finds something other than what you intended you can end up with a pin (or pins) far from where you want them.,0
If it were possible to tell the task to show a pin (or pins) at a specific point (or points) that that would allow for a better user experience.,1
Even if we could just specify a label for the pin that would be better than nothing.,1
"Add an option ""Private"" to lock photos, movies, songs, calendar appointments...",1
An exit button should be there on all application software's.,1
"Show used volume, so you can see how much MB of your inclusive volume is already used.",1
We could just upload a CSR and Microsoft provide a signed certificate via their own CA.,1
It would be nice if a choice between vibration and the sound is given for typing,1
Pin settings 'airplane mode' 'wifi' etc in the start screen,1
"Allowing for tester groups or ""profiles"" would allow for efficient test setup in the Marketplace, especially for multiple products, by allowing a group to be assigned to the app as it is entered in the Marketplace as a beta.",1
"Additionally, it would be great to have additional support for Enterprise developers that target a specific set of clients as opposed to the public masses of the Marketplace.",1
"First, an Enterprise Developer account could be established with a cost of, say $499, which is high enough to deter hobbyists or smaller companies from enrolling, while at the same time providing additional benefits to larger ""enterprise-level"" corporations.",1
"Ideally, a mini storefront or splash page for the company and product would help draw in clients.",1
"Allowing for tester groups or ""profiles"" would allow for efficient test setup in the Marketplace, especially_�_ more",1
"If the app shows sensitive data when deativated, it would be good to be able to use a different image for fast app switching instead of a screenshot of the application",1
"Daemon service should be turnable on and off per app basis, in the same way like periodic tasks.",1
Microsoft should advertise windows phone development APIs in Visual Studio,1
"Please make it instead fire an event, which could be used to open an app's search bar or page.",1
At least support displaying static GIF image.,1
"Back and forward buttons needed, not the capacitive back button.",1
Please consider to enable support for unsafe code in Silverlight and Xna apps.,1
Maximizing all current main apps would be better than having 1mil appd in the marketplace.,1
Create option to allow Periodic Agents to run even if app has not been opened for x days.,1
This gives my family up to four LIVE accounts.,0
"On an Xbox, we can log in and play games no problem, yet a W7 phone allows for only one user.",0
"I can't even log in to another account to check or edit it, let alone play games with it.",0
A certain rival brand of phones allows users to switch between their LIVE equivalent accounts with no problems whatsoever.,0
"I bought my WP7 phone with gaming in mind, but there's more than one gamer in this house - please make it possible for several gamertags to be used on one device!",1
Keeping the message as draft when exiting would save me the hassle of having to type it again...,1
Can we have windows phone development using visualstudio lite IDE which includes only phone developement.,1
"Start by expanding the number of apps that can use a certain key word, such as ""childrens stories"" so that new apps who innovate can displace those who got their first with potentially crappy apps.",1
"Secondly, you need to limit the number of apps that a publisher can submit with a particular key word.",1
"We should have some way within our app to get notify that whether user selected call, don't call and when he/she ended call means notification of end call.",1
"It would be more useful if specific Service apps could be released that would extend these features by, for example, adding a Google+ option to the sharing interface.",1
"Would be nice if in power point, could have same method as in pictures hub for navigation.",1
"Received from an MVP this week over email: It would be great to be able to have the emulator location data use the NMEA file format - either via file import/export, or using the files directly as a feed.",1
Other devices use this format and it would be great to see it supported by Windows Phone.,1
they all use Sip so it would be great to have a native sip client integrated.,1
Also a T9 keyboard would be nice too.,1
I want to be able to add a picture to the media library and then start the SharePictureTask to let the user see and share it from the Pictures Hub,1
Remove the 50 apps limit from the phone and 100 app limit from the marketplace web site when users search for an app with a search term.,1

I would like to see a monthly/yearly subscription model introduced that let me charge users $5 a year for my app for example.,1
We really need Assembly Binding Redirection (or Publisher Policies) in Windows Phone!!,1
It would be great if you could add .png support to the medialibrary so that we can save high quality png files to the picture library.,1
"Being able to use simple uncompressed .wav files would open up many possibilities for ring tone editors, and make files recorded from the microphone ready to be used as ringtones.",1
It would be great if the Windows Phone development team could allow us to use the RSTP streaming protocol in .NET Compact Framework we use.,1
Provide preference setting to categorize apps in the long list by their categories in app store rather than names or alphabetical order...this is extremely helpful for people with lots of apps and provide the ability to maintain the uniformity of the UI while making it more user friendly,1
This will provide more usability of the live tiles on the start menu..especially when one needs to drag multiple tiles through long list,0
Please get metequotes to make metatrader for Windows Phone.,1
"Need of Logger Class to log error,Info,Verbose and daemon Information.",1
As it is available in android.It improves the debugging process.,0
"It displays the certificate signer information, but you could easily upload two certificates with different CNs (service names) issued by a single CA and you would have no way of telling them apart.",0
"Minimally it should show the CN from the subject which matches the service name you provide in client code, along with the CN of the signer.",1
Ideally it would allow you to download the certificate for verification or at least provide a md5 hash of the uploaded certificate.,0
Right now you can upload an unsupported certificate or even self-signed cert and apphub will not provide any feedback.,0
Allow the user to be able to set a custom reminder time such as 2 hours or 1.5 hours before the Calendar entry.,1
At present you only provide fixed values like 1hr or 18hr before!,0
tesco club card app shows you points and you have you clubcard bar code avaible on your phone to scan at checkout,0
"apps has your nectar that you are able to scan in stores, also shows you your points balance, and allows you to shop online and collect more nectar points.",0
I would like a button I can click that will only select the countries for which Microsoft already accounts for any taxes.,1
Support file transfer such as PDF files,1
A bevy of restrictions can also be heaped on the said user control in order to maintain performance and not sap battery life.,1
"Let Live tiles be live, please.",1
when an alarm pops up an option to edit the reminder should be included instead of having to constantly hit snooze or exit the reminder and go into the object itself,1
I need a posibility to set the keyboard language from code.,1
"the focus on TextBox1 opens the keyboard with the german layout, the focus on TextBox2 opens the keyboard with a greek layout.",0
"on desktop under net 2.0/3.5 is this no problem: Windows Forms: InputLanguage.CurrentInputLanguage = InputLanguage.FromCulture(new System.Globalization.CultureInfo(""ar-EG"")) WPF: (This is exact what i need) InputLanguageManager.SetInputLanguage(textBox1, new System.Globalization.CultureInfo(""en-US"")); InputLanguageManager.SetRestoreInputLanguage(textBox1, true); I have tested this and it works fine.",0
"If the keyboard is not installed, nothing changes and the current layout remain.",0
"Please implement this, it is important for me for a translation application.",0
"I suggest to create hardware ratings, like ones in Winows 7 (WEI), for the smartphone in order to help both users and developers to match hardware with apps or games.",1
I think that this ratings will even enable developers to create different versions of the same app pointing to specific hardware.,0
It would be nice to be able to use the computer keyboard when using the emulator.,1
It's a bit frustrating to type with the mouse.,0
"we can't use some important libraries in the background agent like ""Microsoft.devices.sensors"" that limite our power to creat a good application",0
"currently you can only pin an album, but it would be useful if you can pin a single image as a tile.. that way you have easy access to a it.",1
"school schedule, bus route, or a picture of someone you like...",0
The current AdControl crashes any app which uses the silverlight/XNA hybrid mode.,0
Apparently this has never worked nor communicated to Devs!,0
"I normally wouldn't say ""This is unexceptable"" but given that silverlight/xna hybrid is the new big thing for WP7, this issue needs immediate attention.",0
...which is useful if you want to add an appointment with the same time/location/notes as a previous one.,0
"Currently when you press and hold an appointment in the calendar, you have the option to Edit or Delete.",0
"You either have re-enter all the info, or change the date of the old appointment (but that's not ideal because you lose record of old appointments)",0
"local scout should show more than just 20 results, there should be the ability to state the radius from current location and all businesses within that radius should be shown, which could greatly exceed 20. also, if searching a company name for a small business/restaurant, it would be good if that could show within local results.",1
"often i try to search for a restaurant and there is no result under local, instead i have to find their website and then their postcode.",0
"this would save me that hastle, and make planning journeys much simpler.",0
Allow an app to disable text messaging preview.,1
Allow users to link their app with the 'me' and 'people' hub directly.,1

"Allow access to raw data such as signal strength imformation to allow creation of indoor location positioning using available wifi, bluetooth or cellular networks when no gps data is available.",1
It would be nice if there were an app that logged things that happen on your phone: ie.,1
 it would be also great if there were an icon in the status bar that indicates that that are new events/notifications..,1
I'd like the ability for an application to be quick loaded from the right-hand corder of the lock keypad.,1
"If that's not possible, allow a button to be overriden and pressed during the locked screen process.",1
"Also, I want to be able to set the % left of power for when the batterysaver kicks in.",1
The default setting is way too late--I'd prefer 50% or more remaining before turning on.,1
It'd be very convenient for developers without actual devices to test their apps for the certification requirements if everything could actually be tested with the emulator.,1
Please upgrade the YouTube App by Microsoft Corp. with Metro UI instead directing to a mobile site.,1
Expose the SongCollection class so we can add and remove song objects from custome song collections.,1
Allow the BackgorundAudioAgent to utilise the XNA framework so that the device's song library can be played and manipulated from the background.,1
You would also need to provide a conversion mechanism to convert a Song to an AudioTrack - as is the default file type for the BAP.,1
Relax the restrictions around application running under a locked screen and/or in the background.,1
Unless of course we go with a predetermined SongCollection such as SongCollection limitedPlaylist =_�_ more,0

"This should also allow apps to read existing videos, modify frames and write them back.",0
for gps tracking apps,0
"There is an Android app which displays all local wifi connections, with their channel number, strength and, of course, name.",0
WPF7 should have one like this too!,0

The same can't be done with 3rd party apps implementing background audio streaming like soundtracker etc.,0
"Hello, thank you for this site.",0
I was very happy to be able to scan barcodes from the search button and I would like to use this in my application.,0
The design guidelines should be the law.,1
"Don't allow ugly interfaces, be stricter on things like navigation, general look and feel, even animation.",1
"Give developers good explanation what they do wrong, and enforce good design.",1
"If something is unresponsive, it should not be allowed unless there is a clear and good reason for it.",1
"Apps should take no longer than 2-3 seconds to start, and need to explain why they would take longer.",1
Make the marketplace of the highest quality out there!,1
"Support for WEBGL like the rest of the world - Microsoft have done this too many times - we as MS developers are starting to look stupid 5 years behind on the mobile market - Ballmer ""iPad's are just under powered PC's"", Gates ""the internet is just a fad"" enough admit you are wrong early rather than late it's much easier that way.",1
The biggest problem I almost exclusively run into when working on WP7 apps is the layout performance of Silverlight.,0
It's takes quite some effort to work around that problem.,0
And according to web searches about this problem I felt that I'm not a lone with this.,0
It'd be great if you would work on a solution to improve the situation.,0
too often we come across a word in an app we might not know or we just want to confirm the meaning of it we colud look it up right where u r without the need to exit n go in to another app.,1

Return back a multi-task support (may be optional?) will significal improve advanced users experience.,1
"In current situation its almost impossible to create some kind of applications, such as different trackers, survilence etc",0

A demo or prototype category like it exists on Android would solve this issue.,1
"As of now the number of contacts that can be added to a group is restricted to 20, please remove the cap.",1
Already music streaming is supported but only for single songs.,0
would't it be great to add albums to SkyDrive and stream them directly from there.,1
Prefferably the albums would be integrated in the music & videos hub similarly to jow SkyDrive pictures are integrated in pictures hub,1
All notifications should exist in a pull down shade in iOS/Android style.,1

"If phone is lost allow remotely setting custom message on the lock screen, i.e. contact information.",1

"If you look at all of the most popular programs in any field (Photoshop, Office, Chrome, etc..) one thing is always constant and that is 3rd party extensability.",0
Bring this to Windows phone to all native apps.,0
"Instead of making a new camera app, allow me to extend the native one.",1
"Bring this to all of the native apps including office, the dialer, people hub, etc...",0
TAB is usefull to jump from textbox to another e.g.,0
in the registration forms using only the keyboard.,0
Arrows keys to move easly throught the text!,0
When you have more than 5 Groups you need to scroll down in case you want to find a single Contact.,0
The [A-Z]-Button should open the Letter-grid to jump to the desired point in the list.,0
i would like it to work just like the walgreens app,0
The mango way to switch between tab is slow as .... so please implement a quicker way to do that or roll back to the previous IE's chrome.,1
greater permission to manage the music.,0
"help define the current position of the current music with the mediaplayer Zune ""seek position"".",1
"to obtain another possibilities to move in the music as the default button ""fast forward"".",0
"In a windows desktop, ALT+TAB is used to switch quickly between apps.",0
We need something just as fast in WP7.,0
"One suggestion is: Double tap home icon quickly, to see the list of open apps - as shown currently.",1
This is faster than holding down the Back key for some time.,0
zune payer should support custome codec plugin so one can play any format.,1
Please expand the MessageBoxButton option in Silverlight to include a Yes/No or Yes/No/Cancel option.,1
It would be nice to have a modal control that is standard between applications with additional user choices available.,1
the mutitasking area should have every app that you have opened in it.,1
The last five should be frozen and any more than that should have to restarted.,1
To close an app the user should be able to use her/his finger to flick it upwards WebOS style.,1
"In addition, the user should be able to take a screenshot within the multitasking area by using a finger gesture to drag the app towarda the bottom of the screen, a screen capture icon should appear and the outer edges of the icon should fill with green and onve the edges are_�_ more",1
It will be very useful if you can asign a static IP,1
IPv6 begins to be widely supported.,0
It was available in WM6.5 (and older) so it would be great to see this included in WP7 (and later),0
allow sync of ms exchange notes,1
"because push notifications can easily go unnoticeable, there should be a history in the ""me"" tile that will also tell you if you missed something.",1
Tile counts are nice but I dont have every app pinned nor do I want it that way.,0
Just a history for one days notifications would be enough.,0
"It would be really nice to have a ""Share"" task that I could pass a stream to, in order to share an image.",1
This task could bring up the same interface when I share an photo from my pictures library.,0
It would make it simple to share photos to facebook and twitter if the user already has it setup.,0
It would also make it possible to finally share photos via sms and email programmatically.,0
"Examples: Google should be able to add Google+ support to me, people hubs.",0
Amazon should be able to integrate their cloud music seamlessly with music+video hub.,0
Flickr should be able to integrate with picture hub.,0
When searching in the market you should be able to open the app if already installed.,1
"Please provide APIs for call forwarding and other call management functions(hold/unhold,swap,conference,etc)",1
"As a user, I would like to be able to select songs that I have put on the device (from my library) to wake up to.",1
"As a developer, I can only allow the user to choose from songs that I included with the app.",0
The main work-around I've seen in the various alarm clock apps is to force the user to keep the app open over night which is not particularly awesome for battery life.,0
Add an option to customize the size of Pictures uploaded to Skydrive or send via mail.,1
Also add an option to autoupload full images tu Skydrive and not only 718x538 px as preset on the lumia 800.,1
"Right now, you can start apps by holding down the Windows button and saying ""start appname"".",0
"It would be great if you could start an app while adding some instructions, for example: ""Facebook, show me messages"" ""Office, create new Word document"" ""Prime TV, mark House Season 1 Episode 4 as watched""",1
"when holding my phone in one hand, the palm of my hand just below my thumb come very close to the search button and a stretch to far can often send me off to the search function while i am texting or writing an email.",0
is there any possibilty that these 3 controls can somehow be made less sensitive or become a more mechanical click?,0
"The touchmove event is called only once, when I move my finger across the screen.",0
So I can't create complex HTML pages with a fixed header and a scrollable content.,0
I will move the content per javascript but I can not because the touchmove event is not triggered.,0
Please implement the whole TouchApi in the Internet Explorer and the WebBrowser Control.,1
This is VERY IMPORTANT for mobile websites because iPhone and Android support this.,0
Emails are non editable while,0
Enable picture password as in Windows 8.,0
deleting multiple for sms as email services,0
"I am thinking about a SDK to allow me to create an ""account app"".",0
"So like google, facebook, linkedin I want to create contacts, calendar and access to message hub (also writing messages with my account).",1
Marketplace upload of this kind should be more restricted to avoid problems.,1
"When I'm reading a web page or other document, I would find it incredibly useful to be able to jump to the jump of the document without endless swiping.",0
if more elements one day.,0
We cant see the other:(,0
it is slightly fustrating when one or two screenshots take longer to load and you cannot skip them while swiping through the images.,0
Like windows mobile 6.5 and older version.,0
"Currently, you can only have the review page from the app list with the contextual menu.",0
"It will be pleasant to go the main page of the app in the marketplace to see the general pr��sentation, screenshots & the other users reviews",1
add capability to enter manual parametets for visual voicemail,1
currently in the all applications view tge jumplist appears only when there are more than 40 apps.,0
i have about 30 apps and it is already difficult to find an app ...i think the jumplist shuld be always available.,1
I believe scrolling should be improved.,0
"As sometimes when users are viewing a long document, they sometimes might want to skip to the middle/lower section.",0
But scrolling seems to take a little long..,0
"Thus, this idea is actually for the developers to make scrolling faster after each subsequent scroll, like every 5 scrolls the scrolling speed will increase..",0
"ensure that we can buy clips, movies and videos directly to WP7 without necessarily going through a PC",1
Swipe from the top down with two fingers and flick through the last closed app as seen in Windows 8.,0
"For instance, email and messaging notifications could be silenced at night, whilst call ringtones would function as normal.",0
by benchmarking a developer a good developer work.,0
it will encourage a developer to design better apps and it makes very easy for customers to choose the right apps ibstead of selectibg some poorly designed apps and wasting the time..,0
I see many developers can be benefited from text2speech api.,1
It can also bring in whole range of new apps for windows phone.,0
"In Android For C2DM , Google is providing free account and restrict number of messages per day.",0
Supporting Windows Authentication could be very usefull for example writing app that interacts with Microsoft Dynamics CRM,1
currently only a defined set of extensions are supported for files to upload to SkyDrive using the new live API which limit really the usage of the API.,0
For example my app can export .CSV files and I had to rename their extensions to .TXT to be able to upload them to SkyDrive using the live API.,0
The language should be a search critreria for apps and games.,1
The non-english marketplaces are filled with apps that support only english and it is hard to find apps in my native language.,0
If it's MS Windows Phone then make it as a part of the network.,1
Will see all shared resources.,0
One shared folder can be set on phone device.,0
Easy to access and transfer on both sides PC-Phone.,0
A business feature that would be really nice to have support for it the ability to tie into a VoIP network for voip phone calls... the most common architecture is the SIP (Session Initiation Protocol).,1
So I would like the ability to configure a SIP client that ties into our VoIP PBX and phone system.. so my WP7 would basically become my desk phone (extension).,1
The only way this would really work well is if it ran in the background like the phone's native phone functionality.,0
If there is an app developer the a customer lukes i'd be good to see everything that they have made.,1
"Full (or almost) Entity Framework support, including graphic class designer and interop with regular EF assemblies, making it easy for developers to reuse model and persistence classes in the phone, without the need to redo all the work in Linq and some nasty tricks.",0
It would be nice to have the Deployment ability on my home PC able to be done wirelessly.,1
"This includes deploying in Visual Studio while developing, and using the Application Deployment Tool that is installed w/ the dev tools.",0
"For me, the benefit would be that when I don't have a microUSB cable handy, I can still dev and deploy to my phone to try something out, or deploy my friend's XAP to my phone w/o having to go find a cable first.",0
"This could be implemented via WiFi, of course (since Zune does wireless Sync already), or even Bluetooth once we get Bluetooth data transfer ability.",0
Wp7.5 lacks USB audio functionality with Microsoft Sync in cars.,0
Bluetooth playing audio is very limited.,0
Requesting MTP and mass storage functionality since competitors like iPhone are able to do all this already with Sync.,1
"In IsolatedStorage ,image file can save to local MediaLibrary,why not record wave file can not?",0
too slow and too little possibilities,0
I took a while until I realized that I forgot {StaticResource} within the Style attribute...,0
It's very hard to create application supporting multiple languages.,0
"Give functionalities like Resource manager, as given by IDE of other platforms.",1
Managing resources and folder structure for them should be made easier.,1
make an EQ for the mp3 player...at the moment the volume it's really low,1
Curently 20 persons max.,0
"Please enable pinning of the ""Wi-Fi"" settings on Start page.",1
SplashScreenImageLight and SplashScreenImageDark would be great!,1
"After that, it would be great to have the option to select an image from IsolatedStorage so that my app can update its splash screen image as needed.",1
Make it so that a meteo style app would only need to adapt its UI to run on Windows phone.,1
It would also be nice to have to deploy only one package to the marketplace but only the needed bits would be tranfered.,1
Add movies and books would be an excellent addition for the system !,1
"Enable Speech Command to play songs selection by saying ""play song name"", ""play artist"", ""play album"".",1
I believe the single most important thing for Windows Phone to be successful is that users in all countries should have the same services available.,1
Now when the marketplace has become available it would be great if users in other countries than US could migrate their accounts to the country they really live in.,1
"Since windows phones are selling hot in countries like India, browser should start displaying Indian language characters.",1
Allow user to set different accent colors for different tiles.,1
"we should have small tiles instead of a long list of apps of which you downloaded, like android and ios.",1
An app should be able to publish a service that is disvoerable and consumable by other apps.,1
"For example, if I have an app that can process images, I want other apps to be able to dicover my app and submit photos for me to process.",1
I would like access to a stream for music played via the media library.,1
"i wish the functionality to access and synchronize the public folder from exchange, e.g. the public contacts or the calendar.",1

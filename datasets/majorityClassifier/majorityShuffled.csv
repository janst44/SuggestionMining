that bit of hagfish slime rhett put on his potatoes was probably the nastiest thing ive seen on this show,0
thanksgiving was last month hello,0
im genuinely worried for links life now lmao,0
here is an idea look at the recommended minimum age for the games if youre a parent and you think your kid will become violent for playing a game first off youre either the issue or youre kid is already a problem second just dont let your kid play those games i have played hundreds of violent games over years of my life and i dont have as much as a traffic violation ticket on my record,1
i blame a lack of access to video games for the recent uprising in sjwstransfagsthese people are so thinskinned theyve clearly never played a single round of any online game featuring integrated voice chatmaybe they need to be told that 50 of the us population has fucked their mother more often,1
sell it,0
666 likes,0
and people wonder why i hate republicans,0
509 all players must be from murica or its bad for your children,0
heres a thought maybe gun violence isnt caused by videogames maybe its caused by access to guns in the first place im just sayin,0
really girls dont play these violent games that is the stupidest thing i ever heard fyi i have seen a lot of girls play these games i am a boy and i play outside swim ride my bike and do other stuff like reading which some of the books i read have violence in them but the people at fox news and most of the public think books dont cause violence next time research the topic before you all blame video games,1
watch it slowed down,0
honestly i totally agree with ben shapiro its crap in fact i play video games at least 5 hours a day and i think parents need to do something at least,1
yeet,0

josh needs his own cooking channel,0
hearing the crew especially josh cheer for link was endearing,0
they should publish a cook book of all the weird mixtures from will it that did so we can try if they did,1
i would travel to the us if josh opened a mythical restaurant,0
i nearly threw up watching the last one,0
will it gummy bear,0
who thinks that josh needs to have his own good mythical cooking channel i know i would love to be able to make some of the actual good tasting items that he makes,1
i also wish i had smellivision rhett,0
i guess you can call it a gag fish,0
thanksgiving was like a month ago,0
rhett eating  those mashed potatoes is another legendary gmm moment that will be talked about forever,0
link is a damm cartoon,0

laura ingram is an idiot but then again she never played a game in her life,0
i love joshs excitement about link swallowing the slime gravy,0

video games themselves can not cause violence when columbine happened doom was instantly blamed guess what  it was just erics way of using his anger on something to enjoy lifethere are many videos on the internet about people going wild after playing gta the reason for that is mental illness not video games,0
whoa wait link actually swallowed something that rhett couldnt this is something historical,0
duh anything pizza will save your soul,0
311 she realized she was proven wrong and immediately switched the conversation,0
smellovison,0
maybe if parents paid more attention to their children we would not have so many school shootings not okay for kids to play video games but its totally okay for parents to spend most of their time on social media,1

people need to understand that desensitization to violence does not equal becoming a violent person also because my healthy brain understand that none of this is real im desensitized to this fake violence but just because im desensitized to seeing someones head being blown off in vats in a video game doesnt mean im not going to be fucking terrified if i walked down the street and saw that same exact thing happen because one is real and the other isnt and the only way they are separated is by the brain establishing what is right and what is wrong if i play cod and then say im going to buy a gun and commit violent atrocities that isnt the games fault its yours,0

the way rhett looks like when link says drippings and juices make me hungry lol,0
that hagfish literally had me gagging watching it,0
this was one of the least productive and progressive conversations on video game violence ive heard so far if yall think video games should be highly controlled or even banned then maybe we should ban media outlets from filling our societies brains with bullshit as well,1
,0

i peaced out 1055 my stomach cant take that this morning,0
yes finally another will it,0
great segment  i am very against any kind of government intervention or censorship  but if there is a link and there may be for predisposed kids based on the data then  ben is exactly right this is a parental issue  we need to be delaying their introduction to these games for our young boys when possible  but government trying to do this makes us even more of a nanny state like most other nations  the government cannot and should not parent our kids,1
i see fox news still hates video gameswatch where youre treading,0
we call it stuffing because you stuff the turkey with it,0
yet look at the many wars that have happened and teachers are teaching it at local schools,0
this has nothing to do with gaming what it is in fact is lazy parenting games are rated parents should know better than to get these for their very young kids if you think your child can handle it why not sit down and talk with them about what is and isnt right or moral oh because parents these days are lazy and would rather the government parent for them its sickening,1
i originally loved rett but i feel like hes just phoning it in for the last few months so now link is my favorite,0
just remember this is still a kids show,0
did did rhett just drink his coffee from the handle,0
i couldnt use anti gravity or jet packs until i trained on video games i was 300 pounds too couple months of running on a game and now im down to 185 and i can anti grav like a mofo,0

will it m&m,0
great way to have big government wouldnt you say these games have nothing to do with gun violence psycho people with easy access to guns are violent millions play these video games and have zero inclination to harm other human beings your opinion is not fact and has zero scientific backing,0
for this stuff gordan ransay would never wont josh to be on master chief of hells kitchen or the f word,0
i guess playing sports games makes you want to become an athlete,0
i never thought i would ever see link tbagging in edible underwear,0
gravyyyyyyyyyyyy,0

lmao fox is fake news there biased af there always trying to brainwash there viewers its amazing how in todays society people are idiotic to believe everything someone tells them and are ignorant to other views you should see how fox censores politics it baffles me how people still havent noticed,1
oh look they decided to reuse the same news story they found in the trash,0
i really love your video gmm,0
well what about violence in moviestv saw was a big fad in the 2000s yet you didnt hear people complaining about that this just doesnt hold up yes in video games youre playing someone and not watching someone but still it shows gore in both sides and is more violent on one side then another,0
i dont like real thick gravy like these i personally think it is a lot better more runny,0
will it condiment,0
i have only gagged twice while watching you guys eat innumerable things the first was when rhett babybirded link with jellyfish and the second was today congratulations,0
dink itsink itslide it,0
i love your show i have been listening to ear biscuits and watching gmm religiously for while now i just finished watching you guys eat erotic eggs and link gag on balut  my favorite  is when your team mixes weird flavors and makes you try it you should come up with mythical beans weird flavor jelly beans or mythical scents so we can be  even bigger part of your journey ,0

le gasp so stupid biased and sexist ugh i forgot where but i once watched a video where they had men in the military compete against video game players as expected the men from the military were better at shooting real gunsaim and the gamers were better at well playing the games what im pointing at here is that playing games doesnt completely stimulate what it is like in real life,0

the question is are video games linked to real world violencemy answer video games dont link to real life violence unless you committed a crimeyour actual answer is yes but no because not all video games like bf1csgo and call of duty are for only peoples who really want to play those games and ignore all news like thatif you are actual hating on the game go hate other games because you will get even more dislikes than likes ps i already dislike it,0
i hate that you even bought that dust and gave those people money,0

they rigged this debate they got a vet that knows nothing about games and a person who thinks they are immoral when he says he doesnt believe video games cause violence but think they are immoral it basically invalidated anything he had to say in peoples eyes who are ignorant of the topic,0

either side might be correct on this argument but before jumping to any conclusions maybe there is a point to study games as an  outlet for people who are unhappy in their life and instead of acting violently in real life they get to blow off steam in a video game and calm down anyway not only games may cause violence but more importantly there can circumstances which have lead to escaping to the virtual reality from the real world in the first place,0
kill it and spill it,0
gravy is usually made with wine in france so,0
i play last of us dosent make me a stealf godi play god of war dosent make me a godi play fortine dosent make me a pro defualt dancerso wtf does games make me a school shooteralso this interview is full of comleate lies she even said she dosent play those games so how can she tell us what is super gory,0

you know theyre from the south when he wants to put basically chocolate gravy on a biscuit,0
well my limits for kids is to play shooter games is like 11 or 10 and up and i believe that every can play games but i think these people who say video games are evil they can have no say about it unless the played and those shooter video games people more like play them for competitive reasons,0
why are we still having this debate,0
thank you for showing me what eating hagfish slime looks like now i guess i dont have to put that in my bucket list,0

i was kinda hoping rhett would take a bite on links candy underwear while he was wearing it ,0
they think oh he has call of duty and gta 5 hes gonna be the next school shooter when in reality its typically stuff going on at home or at school maybe even mental illness i can say this because i have one i mean obviously kids are going to play violent games but there has been little to no evidence at all that violent games cause violent behavior there is however evidence to show that gaming can actually make you smarter,0
do you guys post your recipes anywhere,0

ive watched rhett spew that mouthful of potatoes onto the desk about 60000 times already and i am crying im laughing so hard,0
oreo gravy should be turned into a glaze or whipped topping,1
they say that all these mass shooters play these games but they fail to recognize that almost every young man in america plays them and obviously not every young man in america has gone out and did these horrible things that would be saying being a republican leads to nazism because every white nationalist has voted red before like no be consistent dont oversimplify the issue,1
omg i thought link shaved his eyebrows,0

i literally dry heaved at the grayvomit,0
they should do that will it kill me lol,1
you shouldve brought yung gravy to the show,1
omggg this is the funniest episode ive seen in a while guys the gmm is hittin today,0
the problem with games imo can be that it is a distraction time can be spent developing other skills achieving goals and experiencing new things seeing war simulations through games and movies desensitize people to the magnitude of war people are not exposed to intelligent ways of solving certain worldly problems,1
idek what game they are talking about when it comes to heads exploding and chests opening up maybe gore horror games but thats a minority of gamers and its still not as realisticly looking as movies that everyone watches cod doesnt really have much violence since there is barely any blood and gta is the midline of brutality but its not like millions are running people over in the streets daily like we do in gta dont lie youve done it,0
i just like food i would probably eat everything on here,0
what about all the violence that fox tv shows produce ,0
will it stuffing shout out if you think we should do it,1
will it glass,0
if youve seen some of those gang vidoes where someones head really gets blown of youll understand it is a very different feeling to a game,0

hagfish gravy  nooooooooope,0
within the first 1000 im happy love gravy,0
i had a visceral reaction to that slime no no no noooooooooooo,0
did rhett say a curse word on gmm  at 939,0
1323 right before link gagged you hear josh say omg so surprised that link did it,0
there is no link its not gore just the shooting,0
it honestly depends on the person i have been playing violent games since elementary school and i guarantee that i am more sane and more mature than most people my age,0
yeah ever since i bought a wii sports resort cd ive robbed at least 3 banks and boosted 2 puppies in the face in the span of a week,0

im not really a gag person but this time it got even to me wtf is wrong with you guys,0
ok ok i wish people understood that a lot of gamers that play violent games is just to have a fun hobby every one likes something and violence does not equal games as well as that theres something called a age rating parents just need to do research on the game before buy it when i was younger my parents would only allow me to buy t for teen games and now i understand everything,0
it is basically oreo pudding,0
you make me hungry every time you do this xd,0
killing in simulators will make you a marine ill play nba and grow 2 feet and become a star,0
josh is an underrated genius,0
how about oreo gravy filled twinkies,1
how is pepto not a permanent sponsor of this show yet,0
when link said ros i thought ofblackpink,0
i have much more gun knowledge than all the crazy ass left liberal transgender hipsters due to video games and no i am very afraid of using guns outside this goes to the same argument gun and video games hold the same position a tool in the hands of a murderer they are not to blame,0
omg this episode is awesome,0
will it food,0
yeah thats right boys dont fucks with me i have 806 kills in fortnite solo pro trained killer here,0
so are we just gonna consider that they used smash brawl as an example of video game violence,0
larry the cable guys dream of biscuits and gravy eatin panties come true,0
i dont know but it almost seemed that rhett planned not to eat that haggfish gravy i saw it right form the part where the gravy arrived at the table that link is going to be the only one totally in it,0
u should do will it frynot the food the cooking technique,1
okay but when are you guys releasing a cookbook tho,1
plays violent video gamethe news gaspo i just found a murderer,0
how about putting oreo gravy on chicken haha,0
  ,0
this is exactly what they used to say about movies and comic books back then,0
fox news just stop it pls its just a fucking game not real life,0
destroyed with facts and logic,0
i gagged when they eat the slim gravy,0
i notice how all people who think this is true is old,0
they do that in the virtual world so that they dont do that in real life,0
its just something that the media just doesnt understand is that different people have different likes and views upon things like i may have liked cod since i was a little kid and realized since that young age that every thing happening on the screen are pixels and graphics but maybe the news reporter the more influential person in this video grew up with 8 bit games therefore looking upon these new games and saying ugh these games have pixelated blood this is so violent instead of having video game hating people on the broadcast every single time you talk about video games you should have a gamer every once in a while to have the objective perspective on the situation bad thing is that nobody will read this completely therefore making my opinion obsolete,1
1147 the face rhett makes when he smells the gravomit,0
i can die now i seen link wearing edible underwear,0
when will we get a will it cookbook,0
why would anyone wanna make gravy out of that,0
when i first met you i thought your name was lonk,0
yung gravy train for christmas,0
working third shift is great for being awake when gmm posts blessed,0
gravy is my favorite food group,0
ben ended this when he said statistics prove otherwise but i respect his approach toward his kids but nobody is gonna take my world away from me because its sth we have in common with most criminals  last time i checked most humans play video games most humans eat take a dump and sleep so we should focus on these issues as well,0
did you see links face turn pale as he swallowed that goop xd,0
josh has totally tapped into his mythical creativity,0
this is the only will it episode that has made me gag just watching these two,0
will it jelly,0
i think that slime is the grossest thing they have ever had on this show and that is saying something,0
did a soldier just compare guns in video games to guns in real lifethey are nothing alike the only accurate thing in only some games is teh reload animations and those dont teach you how to get fast and accurate,0
i love the way rhett says good mythical morrrrning he always looks so happy,0
we need less will its gaize,1
is there a seemingly depressive atmosphere,0
will it stuffing ,0
50 shades of gravywell played,0
you dont have yorkshire puddings in the us,0

ive been watching your show from season 3 yes i have back watched season one and two this is the first time i have almost lost my cookies at home watching u eat hagfish slime,0
i love that they say immoral its a video game,0
honestly the fact all of their food was touching bothered me more than the fisheel slime,0
wooo good job link d,0
link standing up with the edible underwear got me lmao,0
they should do a best will it  taste test and a worst will it  taste test where they try their best and worst creations and rank them,1
its 2018 and they are showing the trailer for cod bo3 oh zeus end us now,0
tfw you realise theyve been secretly planning a will it will it all along,0
thats what we need a gmm cooking book,1
i have a question how did they get the gun,0
i think that there were some very good points brought up in this debate about video game violence and its effect on the children playing them  it is true that many of the violent video games are the top selling video games in the us and millions of children are exposed to them which brings about the question if video games are linked to an increase in violent behavior than why arent millions of children acting out in this way in the video they discuss predispositions that may cause certain children to act out differently than others as well as the parents role in these situations i want you know your thoughts on video game violence and where you think the problem lies within this issue feel free to comment and discuss     please its for a school project due in 4 days,0
haha that was a great ending i havent laughed that hard in a long time,0
you should be thankful for veterans first and foremost,1
so playing video games is bad you can play games for a living and retire before your 30 how is that bad,0
they should make a good mythical cookbook like if you agree,1
that spit up,0
1317 is legendary i highly doubt we will ever see link swallow something rhett vomits back up ever again,0
link in edible underwear scarred me,0
why wont rhett and link be spending thanksgiving together it seems like they arent really friends anymore just business partners,0
i want to try the pizza gravy,0
dink it sink it rethink it,0
honestly i am surprised they havent made a cookbook that had all the great stuff on the will it blank series and i can see it being called will it cookbook,0
they dont even know the names of the games or have even played them yet theyre expertsi really hope our military doesnt have the same level of training as a 16 year old emoting and dabbing after parashooting out of a balloon powered bus after taking a site and spray painting ct spawn,0
do will it waffle,1
ben shapiro is nothing but a billionairefunded jewishextremest shill  he has nothing of value to say  move on,0
omg  i am reading your book right now and its the best,0
rhett and link love this comment to confirm that  you look at comments,0

no matter how much i have seen people eat strange and disgusting stuff on this site i have never wanted to vomit more than i do now seeing this fish slime was a whole diffrent story and am so pleased i couldnt smell it or i know i would be cleaning up vomit,0
938 did rhett swear,0

maybe if you play with lego youll become an architect  its ridicoulus that people still think that playing vilonet video games will make you more violent in real lifeif you are a violont person in nature than maybe it can increase violont behaivor but i think the real reason peoplebecome violoent is because of human nature and not neccesserily being exposed to violent content,0
link seems off todaylike more than usual,0
yeah if i had smellavision sadly i wouldnt be watching as religiously as i do,0
chocolate gravy is something that is used in the south a lot no wonder the oreo works,0

i never want to hear link say keep the fun going on my biscuit and gravy my biscuit like that ever again,0
by playing gta you turn into a killer you see what people think you play a shooter game and they will become a killer they say without any evidenceits not a good choice to let a 8 year old to play gta or mortal kombat to not show them images that arent okay for their age they should be older to play those  but if by any chance they do play them  they arent going to turn into heartless killers,0
rip stan lee,0
cant  believe  link swallowed the had fish,0
edible underwear bit was hilarious,0
will it chip,0
i have a feeling that rhett and link are starting to fall out with each other their chemistry seems to be really odd now,0
does link need to touch everything hes like a child who doesnt want anyone else to play with their things there was no reason for him to grab the oreo gravity relax it will come your way,0
now i want crawfish,0
1318 gotta say rhetts projectile vomiting was very impressive maybe it could even be used as an example in physics textbooks,0
pizza gravy  quite interesting,0
why does my notification bell keep turning off,0
my neighbor is in armyhe still in trainingbut he plays a lot of violent videogames and many morebut he never have violence issue like killing people in real lifeand still playing violent videogames even he still in the army,0
my grandma didnt reduce her choice of alchohol enough she loves adding booze to her cooking and i mean not just wines everyone was feeling a bit buzzed after thanksgiving last year she put it on the mac and cheese vegetables turkey gravy ham everything but the salad but you know she added some to the dressing for a person who doesnt drink much it was quite the struggle to eat,0

thank you for making us a part of your daily routineme realizes that i only ever watch gmm at night,0
i always feel the worst on the will it episodes when im gagging at the substance through the screen doitfortheviews,0
games shouldnt be linked to real violence at all no game advocates for real life violence its all just a game and anyone who thinks otherwise needs professional help honestly americans are so good at blaming everything else for being at fault so that their precious little egos dont get shattered,0
link hun you doing okay,0
hey guys,0
you guys should do will it toffee like cover different things in butter toffee that would be interesting what do you guys think,1

i know with utmost certainty that rhett was real proud of the swirl he attained in his hair,0
i love you guys  you  remind  of  g4tv  back in the day when keven perria and oliva munn where on there you  guys rock too,0
no the problem is lack of positive social interactionyou dont want kids to become too immersed in them at an early age or they will disregard other duties and become antisocialfox news has a point that some of the elements can turn people violent specially antisocial youth who are into some disturbing stuff but that is only true if the right stage is set,0
is it me or they just sound a little drunk today,0
will gravy deep frythat hagfish slime looks like what comes out of a man after coitus,0

indonesia,0

will it windows cleaner,0
some things on this show make me gag like the hag gravy literally almost vomited at the sight of it,0
1318,0
ayy was up,0
because call of duty players are school shootersof course blame the video games not the  bad people also the boys video game  stereotype a girl in my class plays fortnite,0
741 you know what it grows on you just like a boil ,0
you guys should do a thing on fruit snacks there are so many brands and they taste pretty different be sure to include motts they are my favorite ,1
hey guys global warming still a thing shouldnt we do som no no were just gonna fix whats not broken ok,0
if your a goddamn psychopath youre going to be a psychopath doesnt matter if you play video games or not,0
rhett is wrong it should be called stuffing nut dressing because it looks like you could use it to stuff something like a stuffed animal or something similar you wouldnt use it to dress a stuffed animal,0
i was just thinking about this last night i was wondering what other things they could will it and this one was one of them,0
nooooooooooo thats not okay,0
i play call of duty that doesnt make me a soldier until im 18i play doom that doesnt make me teavel to hell and tear the limbs off of demonsps thank god for ben shapiro,0

oh my gosh years ago i asked for this episode to happen and t actually did,0
will it popcorn,0
there is an esrb m rating for a reason,0
i absolutely love this show it probably was not wise to watch it while eating breakfast thankfully i ate most of it before the last disgusting will it gravy i was eating banana with peanut butter on it watching almost made me wretch instead of dieting just watch gross out taste tests lol,0
short answer nolong answer nooooooooooo,0
1316 gotta watch that in slow motion hahhahaha,0
will it stuffingkeep the thanksgiving train goin,1
with all these food experiments you think they should have at least started few food trends,0
new intro song is terrible,0
link wtf was that  525,0
its hilarious how these old fucks know so little about video games that they cant even pronounce call of duty but think they know so much that they write a hit piece on it,0
now all we need is some butter toast,0
i demand the recipe for that oreo gravy,0
will it cheese,0
i cant believe im a violent killer for playing harvest moon and animal crossing,0
yeah sure every single time i play violent video game i get the urge to pick up the nearest gun and shoot people like are you serious though video games are played so much around the world but other countries dont have as much mass shooting as america think about it before you assume,0
will it funnel cake,0
seriously pause it at 001 and look at links face,1
so when is the restaurants opening some of the stuff on will it is just amazing sounding,0
i love that one of the crew members was in absolute shook when link did ithe was like oh my god,0
my little brother played minecraft for a total of 500 hours therefor he is a stone cold murderer of animals and is ready to go to seal team 6,0
this is not a cartoon shows fortnite,0
gamers rise up,0
shouldve invited coyote for this episode aswell,1
you forgot the liver gravy on raw tomatoes,0
link fixes his glasses at least 80 times each episode,0
we call it dressing in east texas so i am pretty sure it  just a southern thing,0
gravy is so good,0
we earlyyyy,0
i love this episode its so funny and delightful,0
1256link it might even be goodrhett yea i think it probably will be goodas they both have trashcans in their laps,0
that jumper is amazing,0
wow fancy,0
wow then this means that spiderman ps4 makes me a web slinging ninjalike white male who can break the laws of physics with thin lines of webbing,0
clearly it is the end of all common sense on fox when ben shapiro is the one that sounds reasonable,0
ive played games like this ive never shot someone you wana know why  because my parents rasied me right,0
i played minecraft for 3 hours and im now a survival specialist trained in bashing a tree to make a house i have killed over 300 animals and built fortresses with my bare hands i have slain over 7 ender dragons and mined over 23 blocks of obsidian with a carrot some say this is not possible but with games like this rewiring my brain to not feel pain so i can bash a tree until my hand becomes a watermelon its possible the dangers of video games are real,0
the audio is usually pretty clean but this episode sounds like it was recorded in a bathroom,0
will it stuffed crust,0
no,0
the slime took it too far,0
slime looking phlegm or splooge,0
you guys should try stuffing the turkey with different things and try to guess what it was stuffed with,1
why not a will it bagel,1
if i play surgeon simulator i do not become a surgeonif i play street fighter i do not become a skilled martial artistif i play rainbow six siege i do not become a trained member of a counter terrorism unitif i play uncharted i do not become a skilled treasure hunter the only way there can be a correlation even in the slighest is if the person is extremely immature or in immense negative state of mind,0
you guys should have brought yung gravy on this episode,1
i liked what shapiro said i dislike what fox and trump are doing basically the same tactic on the left blaming the violence on an inanimate object instead of facing the problems with current legislation also if you want to talk about the promotion of violence to our youth why not call out the rappers that young men in the inner cities idolize and strive to rise their street cred personally i think rap is fine as long as you follow the same logic as video games entertainment is not reality so dont try and replicate it ps many gamers are right wing and have been since the media has tried to step in and make certain titles politically correct in other words youre chopping down the wrong tree fox,1
we need a good mythical cookbook,1
i want to know where rhett got that shirt,0
mabuhay from philippines,0
i dont even like normal gravy ,0

hey everybody,0

josh might be one of the more underrated chefs in america,0
this is incredibly easy to disprove look at game sales gta 5 has sold over 90 million copies 90 million why arent murder sprees higher why arent homocides much much much higher and remember thats just gta 5 look if you dont want your kids playing then thats fine but lets not act like they are teaching people how to be criminals,0

omg i never get grossed out watching yall eat weird stuff the hag fish slime was like seriously the most disgusting thing had to look away im a nurse and it reminded me of the mucus secretions from a tracheotomy when it gets suctioned so gross but still love the show,0
you should see sports riots you got masses of full grown adults losing their minds and sometimes even killing each other because their team lost also sports cause heart rate and aggression to go up as well so i guess we should really limit the amount of time kids play sports,1
do will it eggnog,1

,0
oreo gravy is basically chocolate gravy which is a staple here in the south  had it for the first day of school every year growing up,0

212 sorry but thats really sexist im a girl and i play video games and sorry but games barely a link to violenceisnt it obvious go search it up and theres so much scientific proof proving you wrongso actually do your research before you go around saying video games make kids violent like if you agree,0
i absolutely love the will it episodes they are so awesome you guys rock,0
personya sure lets not worry about very violent movies like saving private ryan no no no no we should worry about this call of duty thingme you dumb fck you have no right to complain if youre not going to complain about its older brother,0

this is the stupidest fucking thing ive ever heard and they used fortnite as an actual violent video game im a fucking skeleton with a unicorn pic axe the fuck,0
so what youre saying is that after i play la noire im a genius detective,0
i play minecraft now i can punch tress to get woods,0
we cant regulate guns because that infringes on the second amendment we should regulate video games which infringes on the first amendment,1
hag fash,0
anyone sense a little hostility between l and r today,0
what an idiotthere is a reason why pegi 18 is printed on all of these games they are just not ment to be played by kids we have this stupid discussion also every once in a while in my country people always condemn what they dont understand millions play these games every day all over the world and nothing happends they dont get that something else has to be wrong with these guys in the first place befor they do st like that,0
it would be a bad idea to ban violent video games boys love violence  and if they cant have violence in video games  theyre just going to do violence in real life,0
they should make a cooking book from all the good will it episode,1
come on lads 97k dollars 3k left,0
i call shins you did not eat the gravy redo,0
are we going to ignore link saying he wanted to kill his kids,0
the third gravy looks like the slime off of ghostbusters,0
nah its not the bullying and being told if you dont do it right 247 you will be a failure and making children depressed cause vilonce and horrible shootings its those dang video games,0
should do will it stuffing,1
btw imagine fox news looking at these comments and seeing 11 thousand dislikes,0
i am from north carolina tooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo you could do will it la take things from north carolina and put them in a la i know you probably wont see this but this was just something i thought of             and it is dressing not stuffing,1
do a will it oreo where you put stuff with some oreo stuffing in it in between the chocolate wafer of the oreos,1

433 when you dont want to talk first,0
thats not even a prius,0
gaming is just one factor of these crimes you have mental problems life problems seeking of attention and mostly aggression over someone people just choose gaming as it is the easiest factor to blame it on and it attacks every gamer out there not just gamers either those who watch movies listen to music or even reading books the media uses gaming to make a good story and ends up just frustrating gamers lets use this philosophy with the bible it holds violence in it with david hitting goliath with a slingshot and jesus being nailed to a cross why dont we ban the bible and churches for this then it does the exact same thing to people but is praised by many do you know why they dont ban it because violence in media dont cause violence it is the people with their own problems or factors encouraging them,0
1313  links face xd,0
this is an absolute garbage argument it comes down to personal responsibility of the parents and they are basically calling children victims of these video games this is not true at all parents are the ones in charge and if their kids are playing mature 17 rated video games its the parents fault dont blame video games blame horseshit parenting i am someone who loves ben shapiro and listening to him has help me realize when someones argument is absolute garbage i am a father of 2 boys and i am someone whos been playing video games since before kindergarten i am absolutely going to let my kids play video games and its not going to be the video games fault if my 2 boys do something wrong,0
men treat women with respect only back in the 1800s we treated women with disrespect but now its different,0
you can tell the two on the left have never even touched a video game,0
fox shut your ass up your trying to get are parents to look at this and take it away also females also play and it doesnt increase violence look at my brother he play call of duty and fps games and he was in the marines and now he is a cop and still play video games and its are property that we pay or parents pay and know youre saying that its gone increases the percentage on teen using drugs fox you can go to hell,0
odd i started playing halo at 8 and the only violence ive been involved in is beating up some douche who thought id share my girl ill keep playing gta and working my actual job while news propagandists get paid 50k per show to tell me how im gonna live my life,0
at 628 is that a reference to bush vs bush i hear,0
id rather listen to cnn explaining an ar15,0

assanation generationbahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha,0
are video games linked to real world violenceno if you said yes you are so sooooo stupid  you would rather blame games instead of physical problems that cause violence  dont do fakenews you will die way sooner than you think books were blamed for violence movies and now games games are blamed because they are the newest go back to blaming books nobody cares about them,0
i literally back away from the screen for the hag paste  goo  spew,0

we call it dressing in california too rhett,0
i love you guys videos thanks for brightening my day,0
you should do a will it slushie,1
yeah sorry but shapiro is right violent crime is the lowest that it has ever been dont rely on how much you see it on the news and consequently how easily you can recall it availability heuristic look at the actual statistics while it is true that many studies have discovered a strong correlation and some even a causation via experimental random selection it is also true that studies have found no long term effect so to draw an inappropriate comparison a child watching a sex scene will undoubtedly get more horny in the time immediately after watching but in the long run will be no more horny than any other pubescent adolescent or postpubescent adult,0
bruh does everyone have an uncle doug,0
lmaooo i got really confused on why they were celebrating thanksgiving late but im canadian and we have thanksgiving in october,0

i wanna see a taste test and ranking of iced teas theres so many snapple lipton arizona brisk honest true leaf how do i know which one to pick,1
the got me off guard with the 50 shades of gravy lol,0
 those who say videogames make people violent are those who dont play them a movie a song the news a book nothing of that makes someone more violent so whyd a game do so total nonsence,0
well at least ben shapiero is here,0
830 its no nut november out here you cant be doing this,0
949 made me question my entire existence,0
i like that whenever he pulled that last fact the news anchor and the other guy changed the topic sortof and ended the discussion,0
i checked the apa article and it said apa review confirms link between playing violent video games and aggressionbut read below and it says finds insufficient research to link violent video game play to criminal violence,0
ive been playing video games since 2007 and im 14 but all i can say is this has been a fun ride since super mario sunshine to gta5 fortnite call of duty,0
slinkily,0
you should do an episode with gordon ramsay where he ranks all of your favorite will it creations,1
hagfish gravy looks like nut,0
no,0
i asked for this so long ago its awesome they did it haha,0
can someone please come and lift my jaw off the ground i cant stop seeing link standing in the candy underwear,0

i am conserverative but this is just crazy video game dont affect violence,0
you couldve had yung gravy be a guest star but you didnt im so disappointed,0
lmao video games cause violence how stupid,0
watching this made me regret more that i misses the show on foxwoods casino yesterday hopefully there will be more of it and in less obscure venues,0

it pains me to see gravy and a roast with no yorkshire puddings,0
happy thanks giving,0

tapping out at the goo,0
i puked watching this,0
i would definitely buy oreo gravy,0
i choked on myself when rhett spit it out haha,0
i love these videos,0
lord i love this show,0
no what a load of shit i play video games not once have i gone out and killed anyone or attacked anyone,0
if you took away video games you would take away the anger relief of the violent video games have also cod will not make you any better at shooting people ironically the moment they said that they showed a clip of someone running on walls and using a jet packnot realistic at all running on a wall and shooting a person with a sniper rifle on the wall is not possible plus kids probably get more violence from movies than video games and what about all the video games that arent violent like marioportalsoniccuphead and so many more there is a reason for age ratings also the woman is sexist,0
gravy my biscuit totally will do it that way instead of the last time i did it with a biscuit from hardees and the white gravy spilled all over my pant leg,0
ive never laughed so hard hahaha my gosh rhett thank you,0
never in my life have i had such an aversion to the cheerios i was eating until i witnessed the slime consumption,0
i got sick thinking of link eating that alien goop omg im dead 00,0
ngl would probably drink the oreo one just by itself,0
i like how rhett and link have become less pg and more like themselves it makes the videos more funny and enjoyable,0
will it gay,0
hey so yall are great love the content but i cant let the hagfish slime gravy ruin this bowl of cereal,0
that car was a nissan altima not a prius,0

we have a family recipe of chocolate gravy in my family that is so good not sure if other southern states make it but we sure do here in kentucky,0
president trump says fake news,0
just look up penn & teller bullshit on video games,0
you should have invited young gravy to join you in this episode,1
ive been playing games for 12 years and the most violent crime ive committed is running a red light,0
rhett and link smashed after eating that dust,0
you guys should do will it crepe,1
decided to eat while watching this instant regret,0

hold on link puts his kids in gravy,0
i watched rhett shoot that out his mouth at least 15 times please make a clip of just that,1
link lemme get rid of this chocolateinstead of removing the pieces with oreo gravy he smears it,0
once again ben shapiro is correct and why all the dislikes,0

rhett can handle link beating him at anything,0
seen you guys eat some rowdy stuff i just about couldnt watch the hagfish,0
lmao this is great wasnt trump the one who was in wwe,0

907 imma dip it in da boat,0
stupid orange niglet trump,0

we call it dressing to in oklahoma lol,0
hahahahahahaha gravy my biscuit,0
will it car,0
josh you are a culinary genius,0
happy thanksgiving rhett and link ,0
they use these to train military fuck off i guess i should race professionally because i play forza ben shapiro is wellresearched as he always is almost all studies show that videogames have no effect on violence because suprise these teens can tell the difference between online and real life fortnite is barely violent at all you people have fear mongered videogames long enough but what should i have expected from people like fox you guys do nothing but spread lies,0
cook book time,0
i have been wondering for a while where is the other chef they had the girl,0
what was with link in this episode he made some weird comments and stuff,0
so because i played nintendogs i will abuse all of my pets to be blood thirsty killersalso why do they only show clips of cod bo3 and what did they check 20 seconds of research its easily to know because she says video games are a boy thing obvious sign she doesnt understand anything shes talking about also no one uses video games to help teach for military the closest thing that they could do is use vr which doesnt even have the recoil of an actual weapon and the noise also if your playing video games the technology just isnt ere yet to actually show real life visuals of someones heads exploding its usually pixelated because the games are already rendering so much it cant have that show up perfectly and parent should actually do their job and monitor what their kids are doing because if their kid is 8 years old and hears rumors about a really popular game that is ao and his parents buy him it anyway that is their fault you cant blame it on the child and finally these mass shooters cant be blamed for playing gta v and then going out and shooting up the neighborhood thats not the video games fault thats a mental issue they might have hadi just hate hearing these news stations trying to shove fake facts down everyones throat constantly,0
link is so linky in this video,0
i need to stop eating breakfast while watching gmm xd,0
as a marine biologist i feel like i can say that you guys have my respectedit its ironic that you two tried to get it to slide down when in fact its exact purpose is to choke things,0
in some alternate dimension rhett & link have probably switched hairstyles d,0
you should do a will it hummus replace chickpeas or mix things in with chickpeas to make flavors and dip pita chips or pretzels in it,1
what if you left stuff in the hagfish slime for a month,0
aww man i started gagging as soon as you started talking about hagfish slim ive never had a hard time watching you guys do gross things until today,0
chests opening and heads violently exploding has call of duty playing where they dont even show blood when shot lol,0
yes because i learned sword fighting techniques from assassins creed how to properly use a gun from battlefield and how to fly a p51 mustang from blazing angles you guys are nave and stupid,0
yess for durian ice cream  great to see fellow indonesian,0
i can not believe that link swallowed that goo,0
you guys should try brewing coffee with different liquids other than water beer vodka wine mouthwash sodas etc to see which is the best,1
wth when their heads come off in cod it is cartoony the body goes flying a few feet and the head just disappears,0
what do they do with all the food after,0
yo its 3 in the morning for me and the only reason im still awake is because of this video,0
cant even pronounce call of duty btw who even plays cod anymore,0
,0
if the world was like the way they were explaining things in this news report everyone would be dead by now,0
umm love u happy thanksgiving,0
yo dont just play 20 hours of cod per day and decide you want to shoot up a school,0
a few nonfood ideas for will it episodeswill it guitarwill it glasseswill it strawwill it bedwill it flutewill it carpetwill it tissuewill it tablefinallywill it clothes,1
is it weird im kinda surprised that they dont have thanksgiving together,0
yes some shooters played a lot of video games but what about the people that played 15 hours a day and arent shooters 99999999 percent of gamers dont turn into shooters these games are no different from books from a hobby standpoint,0
they need to make a cookbook with all the stuff josh makes,1
they should hit up ninja to help them with the st judes thing,1
you should post the recipes after,1
smellovision would probably lead to willit being discontinued because so many watchers would quit against the end,0
718  josh you are totally welcome to join us for thanksgiving  im in nj tho but its great here in autumn,0
why you gotta ruin a good meal tho,0
hillary clinton said the same thing on video games trump haters,0

i cant believe that the left came up with this and the right followed,0
video games can create anti social people thats the worst it can go and most of them are alright,0
so we can ignore the fact that people sometimes play video games to escape from the real world and that people who shoot schools are often treated poorly in their normal lives  they dont start playing the games with the intent of training they go in trying to have fun and escape for a while,0
ok this is the first time an episode of will it made me retch,0
1317,0
keep the fun going on my biscuit  link 2018,0

this show has recently transitioned from g rated to a firm pg,0
i probably have a dirty mind but the hagfish slime looks like a certain white substance males produce im serious it looks like sprem,0
if someone thinks violent video games are immoral i can agree to disagree but the claim that they cause violent behaviour is just completely wrong there is literally no evidence and it is used as a diversion for the real causes of the problem that america do not want to discuss,0
its true bbebbecause its in my book,0

i was legitimately gagging when the slime was put on rhetts potatoes,0
watching rhett dig around in the tub of hagfish slime and pull out lumps was distressing but watching link swallow that stuff was a triumph,0

yes dude plays call of duty and then goes im ready then steps out of his house goes to a gun shop buys shit tons of weapons  because hey america will sell guns to psychos  then goes around murdering people but fox news and politicians blame video games on the violence not the fact that guns are so easily to buy because pressing r2 on the controller is the same as pulling an actual trigger on a machine gunman america keep coming up with excuses to defend gun ownership psycho conservatives,0
if only there was a rating on every video game box,0
rip stan lee,0
it dosent research and studies have shown that video games have no connection to anger,0
you cant practice aim on video games ive shot b a bow and arrow many times before and im pretty accurate but in a video game it doesnt require strength or holding your breath or wind or drop or your fingers starting to hurt i know that there are games like tf2 where you have to worry about drop but real life and video games are completely different and i also know that guns and bows are completely different but you still cant train with a gun using video games because theres different things to worry about,0
of all the things i have watched them put in their mouths over the years this is the only time i have actually gagged myself i didnt even make it to the dink before dry heaving at the sight of that hagfish slime the gloopy clumps oh boy,0
it was a good mythical morning but it was a sad mythical afternoon rip stan lee,0

my teacher is lazy most of the time she just lets us play on our phones or puts one of your videos on the board its weird but fun at the same time,0
us its your fault for letting people sell guns,0
i have been up for many many hours to watch this,0
i cant really side with you anymore youve been doing this since the 1900s and every trendy video game you say its violent and you used goddamn smash brothers as the the background video and your blaming video games about shootings but its bad parenting you always have to blame video games for bad parenting,0

the crews shock to link swallowing is great,0
you had 1 opportunity to use 69 oreos,0
as a female that eel goo looks uncomfortably familliar,0
josh is clearly a wizard talented in the ways of testing the limits of culinary legerdemain,0
boomer prime,0
i rewatched rhett spitting out the hagfish like 6 times,0
698 likes to 88 thousand dislikesmy bullshometer is off the charts  when you have that many dislikes compared to likes youre probably wrong  you most definitely are in this casethere have been thousands upon thousands of studies done by actual psychiatrists proving that video games dont cause violence  most people who say they do are either politicians or people who genuinely dont know better,0

you take the time to tell people to vote but you cant thank the vets on veterans day,0
you know its always funny to me how people who have never played these games debate about them as if they know exactly what theyre talking about its like me telling a rocket scientist how to do his job i dont know shit about it if i want to start a debate i have to learn the basics first,0

video games can not be realistic on a computer or console only if it advanced virtual reality but anyway  not even squad could give you an idea for fighting in a real war  and even if these games could train you they could also train you for a zombie apocalypse or an alien invasion or ww3 people in countries bordering russia would need to play these games  so games do not train you  but even if they did that could be good,0

they might be in a very indirect wayi mean if all youre doing all day is playing videogames alone which is increasingly uncommon due to online gaming and you have little to no social interaction and you never work to better yourself then yes youre more likely to be an extremely bitter resentful angry person envious of everyone else and youre probably more likely to end up blowing up a school but it has nothing to do with the content of the game and there are other ways to distract yourself to that severity besides videogames,0
that has got to be the greatest spittake of all time,0

my girlfriend and i got to see you guys at your show in connecticut over the weekend ive never really considered myself a diehard fan of anyone or anything in particular but it was a pretty surreal experience actually getting to see you guys perform in person considering youve been part of my daily routine for years and that you were down to earthhumble enough to let everyone stay a little longer after the show for a q&a even for those of us who couldnt get the vip tickets in time if theres any mythical beasts out there thatve wondered how rhett and link are off the show theyre a class act all the way and id highly recommend getting tickets to their eventssupporting them with merch hopefully next time you two tour we get the chance to thank you in person,0

i look at what my kid is watching and dont agree with them however i will openly let him watch them  trump,0
it was never stuffed it was dressed,0
just watching the gameplay while the military staff talks lol,0

featuring yung gravy,0
i kind of want to try the oreo gravyproduct idea  oreo spread,0
i really hope rhett doesnt have a stylist and they let him wear whatever he wants and if thats tru he needs a stylist,0
i love you guys,0
i think the parents or kids should read the big m or t rating on the box of the game before blaming video games for being violent,1
this is too funny the hagfish part was hard to watch at work esp while eating my breakfast so i had you guys on mute the facial expressions are great,0
head phones no thank u,0
you should get the impractical jokers crew on the show,1
as always great video lol,0
this is fox news you really think you can believe this,0
all the school shooters they mentioned played video games just like everybody else man i dont know anyone who doesnt play video games,0
link swallowed that hagfish without gaging then he gagged,0
hagfish can be a good gravy since im trying to murder my enemies,0
you know its going to be bad when oreos are second,0
also never take games from kids it can make them depressed and so board the only fun thing is drugs sex and murder,0
what a first link gets something down that rhett cannot,0
is link saying that he only likes his kids when smothered in gravy,0
link was having way too much fun with the edible underwear,0
im a little sad they dont spend thanksgiving together,0
good mythical recipes with josh,0

that author cites a guy who played shoot em up games 15 hours a day which is a very extreme example doesnt help his case,0
love u guys im just annoyed by the ads interrupting your flow right before you voted on the oreo gravy  maybe its just for this month cuz of the charity pledge  i hope,0
i thought this was a childrens show,0
ah man if only hitler just didnt play wolfensteini didnt make this joke i just copied it,0
he was so proud he kept it down,0
mabisco nillla wafer gravy,0
demonitized,0
is pizzay a word  i dont think so,0
they should do an episode where the camera is behind them so we can see what they see,1
,0
its the moms god damn it,0
will it sorbet,0
when rhett upchucked his mashed potatoes with hagfish gravy was hilarious  lolthat oreo gravy looked pretty damn good  it would be epic on ice cream or dippingan oreo in it,0
i have to watch most of ur videos while eating something otherwise i get hungry,0
no there is a study to disprove it and stop trying to shove your opinion down other peoples throat and spread the lie that video games make you violent,0
flex seal or flex tape,0
for the ros gravy i said i would put it on my stuffing and then rhett but it on his stuffing,0
the rose they used should have been cranberry flavored,1
you do know how to make homemade pudding right lol,0
yes games lead to violence i have been abused by my family my entire life been bullied by everyone at my school had access to guns in my garage became heavily addicted to meth and i constantly feel alone in the world yet it was roblox mcdonalds tycoon that led me to the violent ways that i live by today logic,0
they give recruits an unrealistic expectation of what military is about,0
love you guys and i am just as entertained if not more by watching you eat yummy things and talking as watching you eat the horrible things i will continue to watch either way but if you eat only yummy things you will not lose my views,0
do will it soda pls,1

hag fish bite a hole in a fish crawl inside and consume it from the inside out while it is alive until it dies from from being eaten alive   yum,0
is that mine,0
it sounds like theyre blaming the kids who cant buy these games for themselves instead of the weak willed parents who cant control their own kids,0
thats why i dont like gravy,0
am i the only one that loves it when link shouts,0
0435 dat look,0
that slime looked like straight up nut  justsaying,0
2 middle aged deluded dumbasses talking about something they know nothing about,0
the time from when rhett ate it to when it left his mouth and link was unfazed,0
i agree that video games can sometimes go over board but have you noticed that the only people who did these things are fucking crazy its not the games its the people who play them i fucking swear that these guys pulled this out of their asses fox news and trump you are all idiots,1
they cant touch hagfish mucus but they can eat it,0
thank goodness ben shapiro was actually arguing against the idea to some degree,0
i am watching this at night soo good mythical night,0
if your child is being influenced by violence in a video game they should not be playing the video game,1
im way too lazy to be violent,0
50 shades of gravy is a miracle in the world of culinary arts,0

will it kill me lmfao,0
adidas shampoo will it shampoo,0
lol 666 likes,0
some tension between these two in this episode not the first time whats going on fellas,0
the problem with thanksgiving is that it is all so fake everyone says they are grateful for this or that but  no one truly appreciates things on a deeper level people still take things for granted the holiday has become an excuse for every american home to slaughter a bird  and eat too much of food that isnt good for you with your family where has the meaning gone do we just blindly follow traditions without thinking about what we are actually doing because we are used to doing it are the morals that thanksgiving is trying to teach being neglected should we not be expressing these morals year round why limit our gratitude for what we have to a single dayappreciate what you have you never realize how much you care about something until you no longer have it,0
i was about to make me some hagfish gravy so its a good thing i just watched this video you guys saved me a lot of trouble,0
chocolate gravy is a thing my family has made for years so good we have it for breakfast on special occasions,0
will it oreo,0
tbh theyre lumping all video games together like heads explode in ever single video game but that is simply not the case this is a parenting issue and the parents alone know what their kids can handle overwatch and resident evil 7 are two completely different games directed at two completely different age demographics,0
you guys should take the best foods of the will it series and put them in a competition to see which is the best will it,1
ngl that hagfish slime stuff looked like a used condom xd,0

i need to stop watching these while im eating,0
considering that most of us have played these games all our lives and are not violent there just simply must be something else at play that causes violenceif 2 people play the same games 1 turns violent and the other doesnt then there must be another factor that plays a stronger role and we should focus on that factors,1

955 chase in the back opa,0
at 1317  part of me wishes there was a side angle of rhett shot on a phantom in super slomo  but also part of me is disgusted with my self for even thinking that,0
i used to be okay with fox 5 but this is the bane of my existence more antivideo game protests from old ppl seriously you can never take video games from me by the way i came for da dislikes,0
yeah yeah if video games cause violence im a deadly assassin who can take five people at once,0

over 600000 people die of heart disease every year and were still trying to ban stuff because of shootings 10 on average die from shootings come on guys facts dont care about your feelings while i dont mean to be insensitive all of this panic about guns is making terrible authoritarian policy and getting us nowhere and if you do want to find something other than mental illness to blame for shootings look at single motherhood 26 out of the 27 worst mass shooters in history grew up in a fatherless home,0

just a suggestion but what about will it poptart just a thought,1

i thought it was 2018 not 1993,0
its funny how on this one issue the libertards and conservatards are actually in agreement  however the one thing these nay sayers do share in common is that they are a bunch of old farts who never grew up playing video games  its why they are able to make retarded comments without realizing their own stupidity,0
946 i laughed so hard a link,0
im indonesian and im surprised that another indonesian made it to the outro  good for you man,0

good mythical morning yall,0

yes rhett  you were unconscious when you spit it out,0
my grandmother used to stuff the turkey but im from new jersey so perhaps therein lies the difference matter of fact i enjoyed the stuffing that was roasted inside the bird better than the stuffing that was left out,0
may i please have the recipe to the oreo gravy or a video on him making it because that looks delicious,1
is it just me or havent they done this before,0
if video games did this to people gun violence would be through the roof in japan,0
hagfish gravy looks like man gravy,0
so books which you can use your imagination which could be 100x  as gory is not bad for you,0
you should do a will it rusk and then dip the rusk in tea,1
1317 best will it moment hahaha,0
i love rhett just saying yum,0
thank god ben has some scene but that dave grossman lol looks like we got another jack thompson here but this one just wants to sell his book,0
i should really stop watching this stuff on my lunch break,0
apparently that means megaman is my favorite shooter franchise,0
i love how when they talk about how the food was made link goes we took and rhett goes josh created,0
i love gta,0
everyone should watch this at half speed starting at 1310 funniest thing theyve done in a while at that speed,1
proud of link for getting down that slime gravy,0
has anyone ever noticed that link always wants to do the dink it and sink it while rhett just wants to eat the gravy,0
well i play mario and never once have i had the urge to go jump on a turtle point being i t s  j u s t  a  g a m e calm down i play cod and never once have i gone and gunned someone down obviously news channels do this for attention it makes them money like if video games are so bad what about movies theyre pretty violent youre complaining about video games and yet you left a huge global warming mess for us teenskids to clean up but oh no its the video games i just dont get it its the same with esports people make fun of gamers for watching esports because its just a game isnt football a game soccer hockey and yet you go crazy for it but when it comes to video games its just a game i truly do not understand the news outlets bias against video games just stay off our case talk about something more important like isis or irl violecesincerelya fellow gamer,0
smh sometimes too much is too much,0
1318 it leaves his mouth so fast,0
wow ive watched a lot of these and none have given me the urge to vomit like this one absolutely disgustinggg,0

i think it may be true that violent people tend to play violent video games but that doesnt mean that violent video games produces violent crime as the older guy is saying thats the problem with his whole argument instead of video games making people violent its more likely that people who are already violent just like to play violent video games and hes just flat out wrong at 615 we have a rating system from the esrb that prevents kids who are under 18 from buying mature rated games,0
rhett and links 1 word gelatinous,0
would love to know what joshs gmm interview was like wonder what they made him cook,0

2019th,0
thank you shapiro i have played violent games including gta once released games since i was 10 now 43 gta was not out when i was 10 but other violent games were,0
video games are meant to be played and to make people have fun in a world with no consequences even if people take violent video games seriously it will only be a few people and people should know these violent games arent real also why the hell would people use games to train soldiers,0
those plates have gotten me irrationally excited for thanksgiving,0
dis guys are idiots,0
my sister would be very interested in the first one she is a pizza fanatic,0
this triggers me on a whole another level,0
you guys should do will it table or will it shirt,1
the hagfish gravy looks more like man gravy    ,0
being canadian and watching this about thanksgiving is extremely odd,0
rhett you know you can get pizzas now a days that got thanksgiving stuff on top of it and this is the opposite this is pizza on top of the thanksgiving stuff youre welcome worldlink you said it rhett and you know what i totally agree,0
this is not the america we all know and love trump fucked america into this,0
yunggravy where you at,0
hey,0
that last one had me laughing so hard i woke my husband up,0
im sorry but that really looks like male ejaculation,0
a lot of things have been said by rhett lately that makes me feel like they arent friends anymore like they are just getting along for the sake of gmm,0
the lady is sexist some girls play violent games too,0
1157,0
the hag fish gravy looks like a bodily fluid uhhh,0
when is the cooking book of mythicality coming out,0
i regret eating breakfast while i watched them,0
will its is the best series on good mythical morning,0
yknow hes right i just got done playing some candy crush and now i wanna snap somebodys neck,0
the entire eating hagfish gravy process absolutely killed me,0
did anyone open the video and then say to themselves what is that sweater rhett,0
i like it when you say today we ask the age old question then ask a question that no one actually asks,0
marshmallow on sweet potato only in murica,0
right so ive played video games all my life and shot a gun for the first time and found it much more difficult then how its portrayed in a game yet somehow they think games train people to use guns effectively but nah some old cunts think they know better about a subject they knows absolutely nothing about,0
2 years ago i had a dream about this episode and now its out the magic is real must the the oreo gravy getting to me,0
i wish there was a way to make garlic bread gravy ,0
dear rhett link and gmm crewi have noticed that rhett loves his dairy products i dare you guys to do a episode where you eat vegan foods ,0
will it cinnamon bun,0
here comes the sjws and suburban moms to the local news station,0
josh makes a lot of delicious looking stuff but none of it looks seems particularly healthy full of fat and sugars i believe he can make healthy food but would it be as appealing,0
breaking news does retarded news make people in real life also retarded,0
im english i dont celebrate thanksgiving,0
serpent king nailed it,0
i love aroused link,0
poor josh youre invited to my house for thanksgiving,0
pizza gravy looks like a baby slowly vomiting baby food onto your turkey and saying is father appeased,0
should have been cookies now cream lol,0
yum,0
have josh send me the oreo gravy recipe,1
link shall henceforth be known as slime brian,0
they must be so relieved to have josh to make all this stuff now it looks 10x better than it used to,0
in my heart i swallowed it thats what he or she said,0
rhett be careful what you wish for  i believe that the invention of smellevision will kill the show as a big fan i dont want that,0
link is the messiest eater ever,0
i want you boys to get into the great outdoors with mre and other freeze dried food does it insta campfire edition,1
will it umbrella,0
jesus ive seen it all fox news is a fucking joke,0
ahh i see videogames used as a scapegoat for gun violence and the mentally illnice,0
i have never gagged on a will it until now,0
will it milkshake,0
sooo is marshmallows on sweet potato a thing in america,0
around like 115 what link says is hillarious,0
why dont parents ever blame themselves for our generations laziness they raised us,0
will it turkey,0
will it cream cheese,0
juicesmake gravy out of vape juice,0
are yall okay,0
plays candy crush ounce shoots up the school also good like to dislike ratio,0
if you believe they do then youre a retard who never done any research,0
that guy was having a really good cod game,0
we need chad,1
i hate you people attacking video games school shootings are a us only problem explain why japan base of many video game companies doesnt have school shootings,0
call of duty is tame,0
dressing is different than stuffing though i could of swornlol stuffing i thought was from inside the turkey where dressing is just by itself is that true or am i going crazy lol,0
none of those were really gravy i mean the pizza thing was basically just a sauce  thats how sauces are made with butter flour etc  the oreo thing wasnt gravy either  it was again just a thin chocolate sauce  the last thing was literally gravy with wine added to it  gravy really needs to be based on animal products,0
will it casserole,0
so when are we doing will it croquette ,1
video games dont make you violent i asked my 8 yearold sister who plays video games if she will do what she sees on the screen in real life her answer was no we cant apply what we see in video games in real life and video games dont make you skilled at anything in real life i mean i should have been an excellent player if that logic was true and for the shooting that happened in the school in florida the fact that that boy used to play video games has nothing with what he did anyone can take a gun and start shooting people randomly if he actually showed some skills in his attack then we can start blaming video games for that since that did not happen some adults dont want us to think that because of their lack of responsibility there kids turned out to be the wrong kind of people they wished them to be what happens in video games is not real and that is clear to everyone who plays and do you know what is more frightening than video games showing people shooting each other during a war on the news why it is because we are aware that video games are not real but wars are i know i might be so wrong in some of what i said so let me know if i am wrong so i can delete the comment thanks for anyone who read this long comment,0
im new to this channel and i appreciate all the crazy stuff you put inside wow,0
again  show how josh made all this please,1
call the duty,0
they dont give a shit they come in to promote their books lol,0
are you guys ok you both look like you wanna rip each others throats out,0
rest in peace stan lee,0
that candy wear looks like it got human gravy on it being its look makes it look gross,0
yall should do a will it salad,1
donate just a dollar it makes such a big difference,0
rip stan lee,0
dude all jokes aside  that pizza gravy actually sounds like an awesome chipdip,0
if you just film josh making these foods id crowd fund,1
wheres the baby gravy,0
blaming violent on video games is like blaming gun violent on squirt guns,0
so do you think the columbine school shooters were normal people berfore they came in contact with videogames so stop talking about video game violence and focus more on the fact that in the us gun control is a joke and even mentaly ill citizens can aquire a gun really easily,1
if he spent 15 hours a day playing games how did he go to school,0
will it waffle,0
willitbarbeque sauceor willitdonutorwillitemoji like if you like one of these ideas comment which one you like,0
its so un satisfying that they didnt eat the turkey leg,0
gravy my biscuit   link 2018put that on a shirt,0
you guys need to release a cookbook,1
man real meme president,0
stanlee died today,0
here the thing theres a lot of people whom play videogames and the fact being that some of them are actually violent means nothing,0
everyone needs to watch the hagfish portion 1032 at half speed for the drunk version or at quarter speed for the drunk demonic version,0
is it me or is gravy a really odd phenomenon in existence,0
when smellovision becomes the next big thing after 4k tvs i cant wait for gmm to do just a full week of smelly nonsense for its audience,0
how we doing bastards well gravy yeah,0
rhett i dont need smellovision for that it looks unpleasant dont need to smell it,0
omg i nearly threw up once they tried eating that hag yuck,0
i have been wondering where did mythical chef jess go,0
you guys should make a cookbook compile the recipes for all the food you guys liked that your crew has made over the years,1
link  lets not talk about itme  no lets talk about that,0
im proud of link that slime made me queasy and that usually doesnt happen,0
rhetts dollop was the first time ive ever actually gagged while watching gmm nice work guys,0
will it muffin   will it icing   will it whip cream,0
and tomato pasteim giving up on that,0
no more fancy animations when they introduce the flavors,0
can there just be a gmm restaurant where the menu is just all the items that rhett and link have said will,0
so funny,0
link coins the term gravy parent,0
we call it dressing in wv too,0
i gagged so bad its bad enough i have already been throwing up agh that was so gross,0
thats like the only time rhett has had a more violent reaction than link,0
such a weird will it,0
im from the uk and that aint gravy its soo thick gravy is made with hot water gravy granulesstock cubes and meat juice and normally its quite runny or slightly thicker and its dark brown,0
i watched the hagfish part in slow motion and the part with rhett spitting it out is hilarious,0
i wish i had extra money to donate to st judes but i just recently cut my long hair off so i donated my hair to locks of love mentioning them,0

i partly agree with ben shapiro stand on this topic i believe that this is up to the parent  i personal do not believe that video games make individuals violent  i do believe though that video game may distract others and create a shorter attention span since individuals are engaged within a fast paced environment  the reason why i agree with ben shapiro on this topic is because i do believe it is up to the parent to decide on what they want to be giving their child  from a personal experience i remember going into game stop and trying to buy a game that was rated m when i was 12 and the cashier wouldnt sell to me because i wasnt old enough  my parents would also not buy me the game so i do feel like it is should be up to the parent,1
i love you guys and watch yall every day i think its awesome youre helping out st judes thank you guys for all you do,0
well actually its not the game makers fault some games have recommended ages and if they want to become violent it is there own choice,0

okay one it isnt the games fault it is the parents they are taking little responsibility to actually raise their child cause a child plays a video game and the parents dont tell them that is wrong so the child grows up thinking killing is fine and the news obviously wont blame bad school environments even though that might be some of the case cause we are influenced by who we are around and if they do something bad we are more likely to do it plus they used to blame comic books too so not much new here,0
1017  so random  but kind of attractive legit me around my friends cause i tell them everything,0

here in korea eating hagfish here commonly called penis fish grilled is kinda commonplace grilled though not sure when they use the slime but yeah apparently its pretty common too ,0
you know instead of blaming the games themselves for little kids who play them why dont we blame the parents that are too lazy to be a proper parent  and cant be arsed to stop their kids from playing them them selves this is not the goverments problem it releys on the parents themselves i definitely agree with ben on the parents taking control on their kids simulation,1

first of there are millions of little boys as well as some girls growing up playing these games and they turned out fine as far as gta i dont see soldiers playing these games their is a difference between simulators and games their is equivocal evidence shown that jet packs and robot soldiers dont exist on a daily in modern war not just that its more of a individual problem and the environment theyd shooter are around as well as their mental background the fact that violent crime is down means that their is less of an issue on games and more of a moral issue,0
that last one was enough to make me gag a little and not much has made me gag on this show thus far lol good lord,0
pour yours and ill pour mine  did they have an argument or some shit before hand,0

im reaching out over a few social media sites and honestly i dont know if this will reach you two ive been apart of the mythical family for some time now and well you get your voice out there better then most you no doubt have heard that we lost  a great man today stan lee a great man who loved his fans more then most things in life  and i am trying to simply get this out there youdonthavetobeahero and encourage people to do something for there community give to a charity or simply pass along a random act of kindessstan lee wrote about normal people who where given unbelievable powers to make a difference in the world and i want to honor him by getting this trending to show that again we dont have to be a hero with powers to make the world a better place,0

what morons stop looking at one thing to blame and try looking at the broader picture and if your going to argue about it then why dont you get clear facts from a real gamer who can properly defend the ever growing popularity of video games rather than starting unneeded drama millions of people play video games yet you announce the names of a few bad eggs in society who probably played video games you have a choice in the matter of whether you get your kid a game or not because they are rated just like movies for violent content further more try considering gun control yeah its a thing,1
i feel like gmm should make a cook book,1

1131 i guess he failed no nut november,0
i bet that parents are just jealous because they didnt grow up with this gold,0
the gravy boys are back,0
they do know these games have ratings and you have to be a certain age to purchase them so it is parenting but the kids cant buy  them until they are 17 or 18 depending on the state,0
every day it gets more and more funny,0

repeat attempt at a suggestion will it hat,1
so according to fox news and stupid braindead conservatives i should be one of the worlds top fighters because i play tekken i can beat virtually anybody in a real life one on one fight because i play tekken video games may affect kids but it starts at home when the parents see little billy or mary sue playing mortal kombat or halo and theyre starting to turn violent on them maybe instead of being scared of your own kids or spoiling them be a damn parent and tell your kids whats up and punish them take things away from them that they cherish the most for like a week or 2 the main problem isnt games its these parents aint shit these days and thats why you have things called whoa vicky lil tay and bhad bhabie running around be there for your kids love them make them feel special and loved and discipline them when they step out of line if they feel hurt angry or sad about something and they need someone to have an open mind and open ears listen to them have a talk to them its that simple this proves people like donald trump conservatives and fox news dont really represent a non pcantisjws group of people theyre also apart of the problem that they love to preach against its not musical artists video game companies and hollywood to teach your children from right and wrong its your job as parents subzero chunli the master chief supergirl kim kardashian kanye west batman etc isnt your kids parents you are as the parent this is one of the main reasons towards why entertainment sucks today because retards in this video excluding ben shapiro bitching about it and watering it down and hollywood the gaming industry musical artists listens to them and do what they say,0
these bois have literally eaten everything gross on the surface of the earth so theyre going to the bottom of the ocean now,0
please make a will it mac and cheesei think its a good will it idea like if you agree,1

this like to dislike ratio though,0
someone needs to gif rhett launching the last one links answer to will it gravy was the greatest haha nooo,0
may or may not cause a mentally deranged issue  but sitting on your butt all day and not doing real world things is counter productive your physical health and mental interaction with real people with everyday activities prepares you for the real  game yes to much of this junk does cause problems,0

came from the best channel ever cohen btw wtf is wrong with these people,0
i am no fox news fan im not a fan of any of the major news media as i find a lot i dont agree with all of them what i dont understand is why do so many people love watching the extreme violence its not just kids i use to love super hero tv shows back when the good guy won without as much killing now i read so many comments people that love all the violence that the bad guyguys do whats with that i am not trying to be critical i just really dont understand not when i was a child not as an adult have i ever loved watching a lot of violence and always rooted for the good guy and never the bad guy now it seems the more killings the bad guy does before he or she finally gets stopped the better the viewers like it,0

if i had an obsession with the idea of killing people of course i would jump at the opportunity of a realistic simulation of killing people so of course people who have a killing obsession would love violent videogames it is correlation not causation if youre concerned about how young the kids are then follow the age ratings provided on the boxes that are designed to prevent damage to more impressionable kids easy stuff,0

the rose gravy looks like something that came out of my air compressor after running 247 and not being drained for 2 months,0
not a good roast without some yorkshires,0
ben shapiro thinks video games are immoral as opposed to what cutting little boys dicks off,0
so its not ok to play a video game about shooting someone but its ok to have the news show footage of a bank robbery,0
i was wondering why pizza gravy would taste like pepperoni then i remember that people are strange and pepperoni on there pizza,0
will it waterrrrrrrrrrr,0

you can hear how genuinely link doesnt like the hagfish gravy with how he yells no when they ask if it will,0
natural selection the slime chose link as a host rhett was rejected that is why he couldnt swallow it lmao,0

does watching fox news make you retarded yes yes it does,0
f a m i l yf r i e n d l ys h o wb t w,0

wow im impressed with how far link has come eating gross stuff and getting it down,0
it felt kind of awkward being the only one laughing at haggie gyllenhaal nice one josh i would have went with hagatha christie,0
i grew up with chocolate gravy ive been eating it for 40 years my mom always used hersheys cocoa for the recipe,0
so if i play halo combat evolvedi will know how to shoot with a pistol hell yea,0

rip stan lee,0
meerkats    octopus   hawk,0
there should be a good mythical restaurant where they serve joshs inventions he makes stuff that looks delicious but they could even serve the nasty stuff as restaurant challenges,1
yeah i think saying dressing is an eastcoastmidwest thing because in ohio we  never  stuff the turkey we just eat it as a side so we call it dressing,0
1317,0
sorry fox but youre wrong about this,0
im 13 and i agreenot all games are bad though like mortal kombat is okay minecraft is goodmario and sonic games are well,0
im from nc and call it stuffing,0
when link stood up wearing the candy thong i spit my coffee out,0
eh slime is gross now,0
rainbow six siege has made me a heartless criminal,0
so sexism and blatant lies is what makes up fox now,0
ltat,0
when rhett spit out the potatoes i was dying,0
when my notification popped up i thought it said will it gary i was like waitwhat,0
i missed the will its those sweet potatoes look delicious is red wine gravy not a thing in america though not a dig just genuinely curious,0

the tangerine with tall grass speaks the truth,0
i think thelikedislikr ratio speaks for itself,0
link actually swallowed that slime of the hag fish like a boss,0
yes yes it will,0
ben shapiro is a legend,0

im not gonna lie more and more i feel like rhett doesnt like link,0
a video before school heck yes,0
all shooters went to school maybe its school training people to shoot people  same logic,0
youre from the south and didnt bring up chocolate gravy when you did the oreo  lol,0
i feel like every other good related episode becomes more and more like asmr,0
completely unrelated but im loving rhetts sweater,0
you should make a channel or series of just josh cooking things for you and giving the recipes,1

ive watched rhett spit that up like 100 times its so much funnier because he thought he swollowed it,0

yea can we not bring the elderly in on this  take a look at fortnite absolutely no graphic content biggest consistent community in game history ive been playing games for 13 years and not once have i been inclined to violence related to them if i do happen to let my mind rest upon a violent act its something i witnessed another doing or something someone did in a movie i play the games i know what buttons i press to get kills leftclick and r1 who in their right mind could develop violent tendencies from controller interactions hell yea i clicked him real good tbh wii boxing had more of an effect on me in that regard than any call of duty or gore heavy game  this biased bs makes me sick  regulate some terrontino films before you regulate half your countrys hobby,0

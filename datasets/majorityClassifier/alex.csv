"None of those were really gravy, I mean the Pizza thing was basically just a sauce.  That's how sauces are made with butter, flour, etc.  The Oreo thing wasn't gravy either.  It was again, just a thin chocolate sauce.  The last thing was literally gravy with wine added to it.  Gravy really needs to be based on animal products.",0

"Will it Blue Raspberry?
It's a well-known fact that blue raspberry is the best flavor for anything, and there is rarely a time when something blue raspberry-flavored could be considered bad. So how far can you guys push that boundary and make blue raspberry less and less enjoyable?",0
Oh my gosh!! Years ago I asked for this episode to happen and t actually did!!!,0

I'm conflicted because they earned my like but I don't want to see them do this again so telling them I like it is negative aaaaah IDK what to do!,0

These thumbnails are basically click bait until you watch the video and you see GMM is for real,0
"Can we a 'Will it' episode where there isnt any gross stuff in it, i think Rhett and Link will appreciate it",1
I'm literally eating a brownie right now and that last gravy nearly ruined that,0
Josh vs Bobby Flay?,0
We need Oreo gravy stuffed doughnuts,0
Oh Hi Danny from Indonesia! and yes I agree with you that of course durian will ice cream :D,0
Why do they test things that so obviously won't work?,0
Its poisonous so you dont touch it with your hands...but were going to eat it,0
Ive never gagged at a video before but dropping that slime onto the mash did it for me.,0
Dude I love gravy I put that shit on everything,0
"0:25 gathering together is redundant, Link",0
Gwyneth Paltrow... will she be trusted? NOO,0
Will it curry,0
"I have a really really really really horrible 'thing' with vomit. When they got to the hagfish, and rhett said projectile vomit i almost threw up",0
I need to see Rhett and Link drink. At least a Few,0
durian ice cream is the best,0
No matter how much I have seen people eat strange and disgusting stuff on this site I have never wanted to vomit more than I do now. seeing this fish slime was a whole diffrent story and am SO pleased I couldn't smell it or I know I would be cleaning up vomit.,0
Will it State Fair?!,0
How did hagfish slime destroy the Prius?,0
That hagfish gloop looks like a used condom.,0
anything can be gravy,0
These dudes need a break. This episode was cringeworthy for me. Theyre throwing tells left and right in their side comments hinting their aggravation.,0
"I've been waiting to hear such an angry ""No!"" for a long time.
I was not disappointed.",0
I think their videos are shower thoughts.,0
WHY WITH THE SLIME,0
"I thought Oreo gravy was going to make me gag, but now I've written the recipe down for it lol",0
Tbh Id kill to see the processes of making the food made for the show.,1
I live one mile from where the hagfish car crashed and let me say it was amazing and terrible At the same time. I saw a fishy crime scene but also couldnt visit Walmart the town over for the next week while they cleaned up because it was a hazard,0
It's so un satisfying that they didn't eat the turkey leg,0
Do a moon juice tasting episode,0
"I;m laughing so hard my ribs hurt! I had to do a rewind to see if Rhett really did spew said pile onto the table, YES YOU DID!!! YOU LOSE RHETT!! lol wiping laughing tears from my eyes that was great!!! WHERE do you get your ideas?!?!?!?! Awesome episode!",0
"Half eel, half fish? All eels are fish...
Theyre an eel. 
Have you heard of a shark thats half fish half shark? Lol
The mythical crew really drops the ball on biology. Lol",0
i wish link was in every 2nd or 3rd episode.. we need a rhett and stevie show,1
OMG THE WAY RHETT SPIT IT OUT KILLED ME,0
Links faces when he isnt talking man. Im uncomfortable,0
That gob o' gravy jumped out of Rhett's mouth like it was alive.,0
The entire eating hagfish gravy process absolutely KILLED ME,0
"13:17 
Oh yeah, that just happened...",0
"As a marine biologist I feel like I can say that you guys have my respect
Edit: its ironic that you two tried to get it to slide down when in fact its exact purpose is to choke things",0
"I hate when Rhett gives up so easily! I know its terrible and most people would do the same... However, he shouldve tried again for entertainment purposes instead of copping out",1
"Omg, I couldn't stop laughing when Rhett gagged and that nasty thing came flying out",0
When youve already had thanksgiving-  (Canada has thanksgiving in October),0
"Oh my, the more adult theme on GMM theses days!!! Back in the days of chia Lincoln this would never of happened",0
You should get the Impractical Jokers crew on the show!,1
"Link: it's very clingy to everything it touches
Me: ME",0
I laughed so much watching this :) My two year old had me up all night so thank you x P.S does anyone else have to clear their throat and swallow before watching them eat disgusting things?,0
Will it cookie!,0
"how to prank someone

Heads up planters brought back their cheese balls and curly cheese snacks,0
"Living in Italy, I'm going to tell you 1 your gravy is terrible and 2 link your accent is merda .
Che cazzo stai facendo??? ",0
"Whenever you guys have these food shows..can we actually get another video of a ""behind the scene""  vid of Josh making the food? I think that would be pretty interesting to see how he comes up with the recipes!",0
You guys missed a prime opportunity to invent the term Love Gravy #9.,0
"My stomach just disagreed, hated, disliked - I 
Ohmygod please no. I can't eat for another 2 hours...",0
THE age old question,0
I needed this,0
I never realized how large links forehead was,0
Why you gotta ruin a good meal tho,0
Josh might be one of the more underrated chefs in America.,0
The crews shock to link swallowing is great,0
Ok look i love my Will it and all the food stuff they do but i cant help thinking how much food goes to waste... the animals that died for it just to be thrown away... dont know ..... starting to stop seeing these and i love GMM but not these episodes...,0
Will it Quiche??,0
The slime is literally the only thing from any GMM that has truly made me want to gag.,0

I heard a fart @14:10,0
Thanksgiving was last month where I live,0
That Indonesian has an accent from... Ireland? Scotland? Doesn't sound like Indonesian English I have ever heard.,0
This whole episode is just kinda gross,0
I watched the hagfish part in slow motion and the part with Rhett spitting it out is hilarious,0
omg i can usually stomach everything they eat this is the first time ive gagged just looking at them pour that hag fish on their food,0
I wish Josh had his own channel that shows him making everything. Could be called Good Mythical Chef or something like that.,1
"RETT DON'T SAY THE F-WORF
EVEN WHEN YOU GET GRAVY ON YOU
we have kids watching dammit",0
you should do a 'will it' week!!!!!!,1
May we ask how the fire is or is not affecting y'all over at the mythical studio?,0
Thanksgiving is also something that doesn't exist in the uk,0
Will it Waffle?,0
"upon reaching the hagfish section: ""oh dear lord rhett & link, what has become of your lives~!?!!!"" blink twice if you need help.",0
I feel like theyre best friends but you can tell when they are irritated with each other.,0
Kinda wish they did blood gravy....,1
Time for the gravy train,0
"Oreos, will it gravy (ad: 47% OF FOOD WAIST!!!)",0
I feel like Rhett and Link were a little more passive aggressive and tense than normal in this video. Hope they are okay!,0
Is it me or does Rhett sometimes look annoyed with Link? Bro...chill.,0
Rhett reminds me of Arthur Morgan,0
Anyone else watch these kinds of episodes up until the point they start eating something excessively gross? As soon as I saw that slime I turned it off. I love GMM and all of Rhett and Links endeavors. But I am so sick of the gross food stuff.,0
I litterally laughed until i cried when the fish came flying out. oh my god,0
I have an Uncle Doug. He is a severe alcoholic who beats his wife.,0
I would totally buy a mythical cooking book!,0
My thanksgiving was over 1 month ago,0
This is funny fifty shades of gravy nice one,0
Does anyone else love Rhett's sweater? That hagfish had me gag before he ate lol I didn't even notice he threw it up until they zoomed in lol,0
Omg link Haha when you were talking about ros and called the woman who drink it basic hahaha my girlfriend drinks it and we were watching this together and she was not impressed but I couldn't stop laughing my head off Haha your a legend man love all your stuff keep it up man haha,0

Omg at 4:20 Rhett laughs exactly like George W. Bush when he was pretending to understand something over his head  XD   OMG that's awesome,0
We need a good mythical cookbook,1
I hate serial killers,0
Honestly getting that slime down was the most iconic thing Link has ever done,0
Rhett had me in stitches with the hagfish...could not stop laughing...,0
"So, am I the only one why thinks normal gravy is disgusting?",0
Have they done will it casserole or will it waffle will it nugget,0
The option for play back speed was mad for this moment!,0

"Hope everyone in the Mythical Crew, their familes and friends are all safe from the Cali wildfires! Take care!",0
You already did gravy. Will it...stop? You've eaten all the things already. Time to retire the food crap. Implement a new segment.,1
What was with link in this episode? He made some weird comments and stuff,0
Rhett always looks and sounds annoyed with link and it looks really and not staged.,0
13:10 had to watch it a few times I was laughing so hard. Kinda died,0
Guys you need to try will it pillow please,1
Do a collab with King of Random please,1
When Rhett puke and Link don't. This is unusual.,0
"I made the mistake again of eating and watching... I saw the hag goo in Rhett's hand and... Yeah, the piece of bbq chicken I was eating was just spit out and the rest thrown in the trash. Why do I do this to myself?!",0
"You should do Rhetts old idea ""Will it Penis""",1

Ellie's moan at 9:59...,0
"What about Will It Queso!?!? You guys haven't done that yet, and it would be great!!!",1
"Every so often there is a GMM where the only thing I can do is cover my nose and mouth with my shirt and cover my face with my hands to peek out from behind my fingers. Congratulations, the ending to this episode was one of them. Way to go Link!! Also my condolences, I hope you had something to help get the taste/smell out.",0
8:03 tbh my uncle Doug would like it probably  (I actually have a uncle named doug),0
That hagfish looks like a parasite. Why would anyone eat that?!,0
I need a gif of Rhett biting the edible thong sorry not sorry,1
you guys should do will it toffee. like cover different things in butter toffee. that would be interesting. what do you guys think?,1

"My teacher is lazy most of the time she just lets us play on our phones or puts one of your videos on the board, it's weird but fun at the same time",0
Rhett seems like he doesnt like link,0
"I want Josh to come to my place for Thanksgiving! My mouth was watering for the first three gravies! Hard pass on the last two, though.",1
13:18 youre welcome,0
The edible underwear thing had better  be on the next dirty jokes video,0
Will It Soy Sauce hasn't been done,0
I feel bad for whoever has to take out the trash on this show,0
I dont know if anybody caught it but Rhett  basically just made an ass eating joke family-friendly. You forever has my respect.,0
I'm disappointed they didnt take up the opportunity to make the gravy come in on a gravy train,0
"Dink it!
SINK IT!
VIOLENTLY EJECT IT!",0
never have I ever almost gagged just watching you guys eat something. This was CRAZY!,0
You're from the south and didn't bring up chocolate gravy when you did the oreo!  Lol.,0
Let's all hop aboard the gravy train.,0
You guys should do an episode on the flat earth!! :D,1
I actually thought they would put gravy on random food rather than the other way around,0
35 how will it not kill you if it can melt a car?,0
I like Links hair in this episode! It looks clean and fresh,0
When he stood up with those candy panties holy shit,0

"Today we learned Rhett spits and Link swallows

You know its about to be nasty when they grab their trash cans,0
Everyone should watch this at half speed starting at 13:10. Funniest thing they've done in a while at that speed.,1
9:50 BWAHAHAHAHa. I died. ROFLMAO,0
I love your show! I have been listening to Ear biscuits and watching GMM religiously for while now. I just finished watching you guys eat erotic eggs and Link gag on balut . My favorite  is when your team mixes weird flavors and makes you try it! You should come up with mythical beans (weird flavor jelly beans) or mythical scents so we can be  even bigger part of your journey !!,1
Bring back online nation.,1
9:06 why,0
The hagfish was the only time I ever threw up watching this show,0
"Gravy my biscuit

Use the Oreo gravy like a fondue for cookies and other sweets.,1
The hagfish slime looks like the snot you hack up when ur sick,0

Link I am so SO damn proud of you. I've been around since good morning Chia Lincoln and after 1000 plus videos this is the very first time Link got something down that Rhett couldn't eat. Links coming up with the confidence and it's about time. I love this Link. Good job. Love you two.,0
"Will it is my fav series, keep it up guys!",1
That's what u get for having a Prius XD,0

"I just have one question for them, are there food hot ?? It doesnt look like it",0

"you guys should make a cookbook of recipes, like how you make the pizza gravy",1
"You guys should post proper recipes for all the concoctions you make, with measurements and everything! That or release a cook book. Either way I would love to be able to faithfully recreate all the good tasting foods you make. That pizza gravy specifically is calling to me",1
You should do will it crepe,1

"durian does ice cream, for those who like durian though",0
"Yes Rhett , you were unconscious when you spit it out",0
"I need the recipe for the oreo gravy. You know, for science.",1
Oreo gravy should be turned into a glaze or whipped topping,1
"It dissolved a Prius 
... So lets eat it! ",0
Seriously one of the funniest things Ive seen. Crying laughing!!!,0
The Wine one looked like a stirred up Trix yogurt.,0
"This one dinner I thought it was baked bats. But my mums Ex had breaded chicken with Oreos, it was odd. I couldn't tell if I liked it or not. You guys should bread chicken or things, with odd things.",0

"I like will it Gravy! Although it always makes me miss ""Will it Float?""",0
I'm Canadian my thanksgiving was on October 8th,0

Thanksgiving needs a little wrongness... Mmmhmm Uncle Doug.,0
"A little Canadian flare, "" will it poutine""?",0
"When he said uncle Doug I laughed so much, thats actually my uncle's name!",0
boyled for safety,0
"Link - ""let's not talk about it""

I always feel the worst on the Will It.. episodes when Im gagging at the substance through the screen #DoItForTheViews,0

Link rips the whole thing apart and sends projectile crotch beads flying through the air",0
pretty sure rhett and link are missing out on millions by not opening a restaurant with all of their will it items on the menu,0
"I know the day you guys stop making videos is gonna come some day, but I hope it won't be soon because you are awesome! I am watching your videos on a daily basis for years now. Keep up your awesomeness!",1

Rest in peace Stan lee,0
I think they should do a will it thanksgiving dinner.,1
"Am I the only one who thinks hagfish are awesome? Their slime is so cool! Seriously, go watch a video of them using their slime. The fish try to bite the hagfish but end up choking. Its so odd seeing a fish cough. Also they are the only known creature with a skull but no spine. I did a project on them in 7th grade. Go research them!
Or not.",0
"Sorry, but American's are strange. Most of the so called gravy, we would call sauce in the UK (defiantly not 'pudding'). The biscuit, we call a scone, which we defiantly wouldn't put on a roast dinner. And why in gods name, do you put toasted marshmallows in with sweet potato. That sounds almost as worse, than the hagfish slime.",0
"2 men and there lust dust, a documentary by Josh (last name )",0
"Rhett and Link show the hagfish slime.
Me: Nonononononononononono No, no, no don't do it!",0

"Sooo, is Marshmallows on sweet potato a thing in America?",0
"Chocolate syrup is basically ice-cream gravy, think about that.",0

You guys missed a big opportunity for blood gravy,0
That hag fish gravy is DISCUSTING. Thanksgiving is over already... in canada,0
Link.. Smothers his children?,0
Good Mythical MORNING at NIGHT.,0
"The problem with Thanksgiving is that it is all so fake. Everyone says they are grateful for this or that but  no one truly appreciates things on a deeper level. People still take things for granted. The holiday has become an excuse for every American home to slaughter a bird  and eat too much of food that isnt good for you with your family. Where has the meaning gone? Do we just blindly follow traditions without thinking about what we are actually doing, because we are used to doing it? Are the morals that Thanksgiving is trying to teach being neglected? Should we not be expressing these morals year round? Why limit our gratitude for what we have to a single day?
Appreciate what you have. You never realize how much you care about something until you no longer have it.",0
Did Rhett say the F word at 9:40,0
They need to make a cookbook with all the stuff Josh makes,1

The red triangles on Rhett's shirt are really bothering me.,0
If you notice Link took his slime off before in ate his bite. That's how he could shallow his when Rhett couldn't.,0
"Hate will it, its so stupid!!!",0
I've GOT to see Gordon Ramsay in one of these will-it episodes. This would be amazing.,1
"""Very clingy to anything it touches...""
Perfect description of me ",0
This is the first time in the history of me watching this show that I have almost thrown up from disgust. My stomach is truly turning over.,0
My mood instantly lifts when I see a new Will It on my home screen!!,0
"How do you go through Thanksgiving without talking about politics!? I swear, no matter what we're celebrating, if we're all together SOMEONE ALWAYS BRINGS IT UP!!!",0
This should have featured yung gravy,1
"Do a will it Jam or jelly, like if u agree",1

"EW The raw hagfish looks like a used condom o.O
I've heard of them and seen them in documentaries but didn't know they looked like that when ""prepared""",0
Rhett looks sleepy or sad or high... I can't decide!!!,0
I have a feeling that Rhett and Link are starting to fall out with each other. Their chemistry seems to be really odd now,0
"Metaphorically squeezed it's goo out and turned it into gravy
-Link 2018",0
"Chocolate gravy and biscuits, a southern tradition! Never tried it with props though!!",0
"To be fair, Rhett did have the big dark slime",0

4:49 link is lovin it and not even in the same world.,0
11:56 Epoxy? Looks like something else to me (   ),0

"My girlfriend and I got to see you guys at your show in Connecticut over the weekend. I've never really considered myself a ""die-hard fan"" of anyone or anything in particular, but it was a pretty surreal experience actually getting to see you guys perform in person considering you've been part of my daily routine for years, and that you were down to earth/humble enough to let everyone stay a little longer after the show for a Q&A even for those of us who couldn't get the vip tickets in time. If there's any mythical beasts out there that've wondered how Rhett and Link are off the show, they're a class act all the way and I'd highly recommend getting tickets to their events/supporting them with merch. Hopefully next time you two tour we get the chance to thank you in person",0
Who doesn't celebrate thanksgiving? I don't celebrate it.,0
"Yes another suggestion of ""Will It"" coming to reality, thanks guys!!",0

I really want to try that Oreo gravy!,0
I regret watching will it episode during breakfast every time but I do it anyway,0
the last one made my eyes water from almost throwing up i have such a weak stomach i cant even look at it lol,0
Gmm why not triple stuffed Oreos why!?!,0

"I have never seen Rhett look so worried to eat something as he looks before ""trying"" to eat the hagfish slime.  Hillarious!",0
"That grey slime looks strangely familiar, right guys?",0

"Josh, come over for Thanksgiving!' really means 'Josh, cook everything in my house for Thanksgiving!'.",0
Will it casserole..?,0
"13:20 dink it, sink it... Rethink it",0
That has got to be the greatest spit-take of all time,0
Is link saying that he only likes his kids when smothered in gravy?,0
The last one looks like lung butter.,0
U should do will it fry.Not the food the cooking technique.,1
"""Now we've all had a tough day and come home to absolutely pound a sleeve of Oreos.""

I can't believe that you guys eat that Hagfish. Ugh!,0
Nothing you've done has ever really made me gag before. The hagfish snot did.,0
No need for gross things anymore. I think you have evolved past this,0
"I think that slime is the grossest thing they have ever had on this show, and that is SAYING something",0
I love Rhett just saying Yum.,0
Aaaaaah...Bisto.,0
"Ew sweet potatoes, my food nemesis
Not sure if gravy of any kind could save them",0
Good mythical cooking book coming out soon??,0
"My six month old son watches Rhett and Link with me!! He is learning to crawl so he likes to wreak havoc on the floor and likes to stay busy. I picked him up, wrapped him up with me and he just sat in my lap and watched them!! Thanks so much for keeping my tiny monster entertained :D",0

that bit of hagfish slime rhett put on his potatoes was probably the nastiest thing ive seen on this show,0
"I don't know, but it almost seemed that Rhett planned not to eat that haggfish gravy. I saw it right form the part where the gravy arrived at the table, that Link is going to be the only one totally in it.",0
I'mma dip it in the boat,0
Josh was so proud when link swallowed that hagfish goo that was weirdly adoarable,0

They should post recipes so we can make this stuff. This food looks amazing.,1
You guys should do house tours!,1
I miss darts lol,0

I am beyond proud of Link for getting that hagfish gravy to go down,0
"Wow I have tears in my eyes from gagging so hard at the hag fish bit, but I laughed hard too. I gaughed?",0
I finally watched this in the morning,0
@9:50 I just choked on my drink! Why does Link do these things lol,0
Never laughed so much. My wife almost wet herself she was laughing so much. Rett you crack me up pal.,0
Are you guys ok you both look like you wanna rip each others throats out...,0
"You know, for a moment I thought it would not take a gross turn. So I began to eat. My mistake.",0
Will it red&link ?,0
"I've watched literally every ""Will it"" episode and the slime is probably the only one that made me gag and throw up a little in my mouth.",0
Rhett and Link should do Will It Oreo,0
i actually have an alcoholic uncle doug omg rip,0
Have y'all never had chocolate gravy? We make it all the time here in the boothill of Missouri,0
Lol the crew members screaming after Link succeeded in swallowing the slime is priceless,0
Imma dip it in the boat~ Link,0
Rhetts body rejected that shiiit hahahaha,0
Rhett is wrong it should be called stuffing nut dressing because it looks like you could use it to stuff something like a stuffed animal or something similar you wouldn't use it to dress a stuffed animal,1
Food fears: tomato,0
Link got too rough at 9:52.,0
The haggis slime/gravy made me lose my appetite & i was eating my favorite lunch...Chivk-fil-a,0
"That bit that Rhett spit out looks really fake watching him spit it out, it was so perfectly angled and stopped so well",0
I  coughed up something that looks like the dark slime dollop on Rhett's plate.,0
It was a great veteran's day episode about thanksgiving.,0
Yayyyyy,0
I was just thinking about this last night. I was wondering what other things they could Will It and this one was one of them.,0
11:28 That's a Nissan Sentra*,0
You guys should have brought yung gravy on this episode.,1
Ret. why dont tomorrow say Sink it any more?????,0
"Am i the only one who watches each episode twice, just to watch link the whole time through then Rhett the second time through?",0
SC says dressing as well,0
Guys youre gonna have to make a book of all the recipes thats actually taste good,0
I prefer Candy's drawers to candy drawers,0
"For the life of me, I could not resist not watching 13:10-end in half speed",0
"Hagfish, for when congealed blood, painus and salted spiders are to mainstream. Warning: These two do this so no one else has to",0
Link was a lot today,0
50 shades of gravy,0
"Will it hotdog/sausage , waffle, bread, Oreo ? 
If they did these pls tell",1
Loved that sweater Rhett wore.,0
Link loves his children smothered in gravy,0
This is the first time a nasty food has made my gag reflex go off by simply watching it jiggle around.,0
Thank you for showing me what eating hagfish slime looks like. Now I guess I don't have to put that in my bucket list.,0
That last part could make anyone gag,0
I love the way Rhett says Good Mythical Morrrrning! He always looks so happy.,0
Aaaaand that's why I don't swallow.,0
"YES FINALLY ANOTHER ""WILL IT""?!!!",0
This realllly shoulda featured Yung Gravy,1
How can Link swallow hagfish but not tomatoes?,0
50 shades of Gravy...Well played,0
"I have been watching GMM for a long time, and this is the first time that I have gagged from watching them eat something. That slime was disturbingly nasty looking.",0
I started gagging when they pulled out the hagfish slime and threw up in my mouth a little when Rhett spat it onto the table.,0
Goog god the taste tests are becoming late season fear factor. May I suggest Hare Krishna Cow Dung health and beauty tonics and balms?,1
13:13 is the best part omg,0
Why did Link agree like.... that... when they tried the pizza gravy???,0
Im a little sad they dont spend thanksgiving together,0
Rhett has the weirdest sweaters. I love them.,0
Will it hot chocolate,0
Thank you Link. The world is a better place for having you in it. Cheers man.,0
"If Link could swallow that he could definitely eat a tomato.  Most disgusting thing I've seen in a while.....great episode.  I know, I'm sick too.",0
Click here for your viewing pleasure 13:16,1
Hmmm.....,0
noo don't eat with those elbows plzz,1
"To dear 1% people reading this I hope you have a great day/night
Edit- thanks everyone I  never had this many likes",0
Im new to this channel and I appreciate all the crazy stuff you put inside!!! Wow,0
Lol thanksgiving already happened for me,0
I didnt expect to have my eyes assaulted in a gravy episode but ok I wont sleep tonight,0
Watching this made me regret more that I misses the show on Foxwoods Casino yesterday. Hopefully there will be more of it and in less obscure venues,0
Dressing? If you're not stuffing your stuffing in the bird then you are missing out my friend. Mmmm.. All those good turkey juices.,0
this video was good in all but why would you ruin a plate of thanksgiving food like that,0
I literally never gag at any of these vids but that fish slime tho...,0
Yay I love will it episodes,0
I looked at the rose wine gravy and i see no pink then i remembered link is color blind,0
Can we get a cook book of mythicality?,1
"Can we get the recipes for these ""Gravey's""?",1
Aww man I started gagging as soon as you started talking about hagfish slim! I've never had a hard time watching you guys do gross things until today!,0
NSFK. I watch this with my kids. Not the best episode.,0
"How is Pepto not a permanent sponsor of this show, yet?",0
"its very clingy to anything it touches 
i didnt know we were talking about me shit hahaha",0
:),0
"I would like to see ""Will it Hat"" and ""Will it  earmuff""",1
On break at work and the slime part made me throw up my break food...lol,0
LINK DID IT!!! HE HAS TURNED A NEW PAGE!!,0
I'm never this late I'm sorry,0
"Wow! Link become Rhett, and Rhett become Link!!! This Episode is Awesome!!!!!",0
We need a Will It cook book,1
josh makes me respect his skills more and more in every will it episodes,0
Anyone sense a little hostility between L and R today?,0
Yes! A new will it,0
I have been watching this show for 4 years. Watching them eat the hagfish slime is the first time that I ever gagged watching this show. I don't know how you guys do it. Just keep up the good work.,0
We call it stuffing in Virginia,0
so.. which house is josh going to XD,0
It my little sisters birthday and your her favorite yotubers and mine too,0
That slime is the most vile thing you've done. I even gagged (hard) a few times.,0
@2:05 They lost a decent amount of subcribers from italy XD,0
I'm still yearning for a Will It Cookbook so we can all enjoy these discoveries!,1
Will it waffle?,0
when is the cooking book of mythicality coming out?,0
Link is very cringy because he keeps saying ya in a low voice when they were poring the oreo gravy,0
Will it GRAVY,0
What was your favorite one?,0
Have you seen a shark grab a hagfish? The mucus comes out of the shark's gills and everything.,0
I swear that every episode of GMM is secretly an assassination attempt on Rhett and Link caused by the crew,0
put some alcohol in the thanksgiving gravy lmaoo when things are going a bit TOO well.,1
"Speaking of cook books, you should make a mythical cook book filled with all the good and nasty foods you have created in gmm, and gmmore!",1
Hey  Rhett and link on Thanksgiving is my birthday  love all you're videos  and I hope you have a great Thanksgiving,0
Wow Link destroyed that one,0
9:51 what kind of logic does link have,0
Link is a damm cartoon!!!,0
Hi Nice Will it,0
I dont know how you guys keep finding disgusing things to eat but I love it,0
So when's the GMM cook book out?,0
This is the first time I've gagged watching a GMM episode.,0
Anyone else like before watching no matter what,0
13:19 WOW THE ROLES HAVE BEEN REVERSED,0
What do you guys think about a Good Mythical Morning Cooking Book?,1
We got one week till Thanksgiving break,0
"Seriously, pause it at 0:01 and look at Link's face",1
You shouldve collabed with Yung Gravy,1
Will it boil for safety?,0
Pause at 0:01 and look at Link's face.,1
"What is thanksgiving?
#",0
ik that link hates tomatoes and u should do will it tomato sause ???,1
You guys should release a cookbook with all the good recipes from the will its,1
"Since theyre doing this for Thanksgiving, Maybe they could do Will It Eggnog? for Christmas?",1
Will it Hat?,0
"Maybe, Oreo Gravy will be perfect for your dessert as well.",0
"i thought i was indestructible, but that gray slime made me dry heave! and i was ok with pig anus",0
Do do a dolp of hagfish slime,0
"It felt kind of awkward being the only one laughing at ""Haggie Gyllenhaal."" Nice one Josh! I would have went with ""Hagatha Christie.""",1
I'm genuinely worried for links life now.. lmao,0
I vote for a will it stuffing next year,1
"Rhett: Pizzawillitgravy yes
Link:                                yes
Makes sense to me",0
"For someone that HATES gravy, I want the recipe for the Pizza and Oreo Gravy.",1
"I think this would make Ed from Ed, Edd, n Eddy happy.",0
For Christmas you guys should do will it fruitcake,1
"if you call it Oreo pudding, its going to fly right off the shelves and into peoples mouths hahaha",0
9:07 imma dip it in da boat,0
"Happy thanksgiving Americans!
I live in Canada and we have thanksgiving at a different time(I found out its not till the 22nd so happy early thanksgiving)",0
America has not enough of a daily gravy consumption.,0
"Thanks for partnering with St.Jude, love you guys",0
im gay,0
"Im from the UK and that aint gravy, Its soo thick. Gravy is made with hot water, gravy granules/stock cubes, and meat juice. And normally its quite runny or slightly thicker, and its dark brown.",0
Yes,0
Is it me or they just sound a little drunk today?,0
I never knew that I wanted to see Link in edible underwear.. untill now.,0
Ohh link  we call those girls basic for a reason lol,0
my grand parents put grass in gravy,0
Rhett and link love this comment to confirm that  you look at comments,0
"Link: Lemme get rid of this chocolate
Instead of removing the pieces with Oreo gravy, he smears it",0
Do tomatoes and liver make everything worse?,0
I have an Uncle Doug,0
A sleeve of Oreos? One sleeve? LoL amateurs,0
Will it beans?,0
Everyday I watch this show while eating breakfast and on days where the episode is like this I whole regret it.,0
"This is just the episode of things Link doesn't like. Tomato, turkey, Oreos...",0
Did anyone know that rhett is 2m tall,0
Someone needs to introduce Rhett to Thanksgiving clapback memes,1
If your yams (or sweet patatoes) have marshmallows on top they were prepared wrong.,0
"I dont remember the last time I laughed as hard as I did, when Rhett accidentally spit the slime out. I rewound it 3 times. Absolutely hilarious.",0
What happened to the other lady that used to cook the food?,0
You guys say you're from North Carolina but you didn't do chocolate gravy? Shame on you. Just kidding.,0
Still want to see Will it casserole.,1
I think Link lost all Italians trust.,0
I lost it when link stood up with that underwear lol but i lost it more when rhett coughed up his piece,0
Wow mythical crew has managed to find something grosser than anything poor R&L have had on this show before.,0
all of the gravy is so thicc like damnnn,0
"Oh man, at first I thought I had clicked on a month old video until I remembered that I saw the 4 hours ago time stamp and then remembered that y'all celebrate Thanksgiving a month after us",0
I should really stop watching this stuff on my lunch break...,0
WILL IT BEEF STEW,0
"I was eating over easy eggs n popped a egg open as u said"" it's like the stuff in a boil"" my dogs enjoyed my eggs",0
What is a biscuit? As link refers to it? It looks like what we in the UK call a Scone...are they similar or am I way off?,0
Will it Oreo?,0
The Oreo one would make a good drink. I want it now!!!,1
"Will it ice-cream (if ya'll really did that, part from ice-cream sandwich i'm late)",0
That Oreo gravy would be awesome on ice cream!,1
"You do know how to make homemade pudding, right? lol",0
13:27 Link just did his best Gene Simmons/Kiss impression!!!,0
"Hold on, Link puts his kids in Gravy?",0
"I am a respiratory therapist and I have seen lots of slime. That hagfish stuff was enough to make me gag, a truly rate event. I think eating scorpions has toughened Link up!",0
"I'm so glad this episode wasn't as gross as other ""will it?""s. it used to be coming up with weird, sometimes icky creations and then became a ""what will make Rhett and Link puke the fastest?"" show. I appreciate that the gravies were toned down a bit (for the most part lol)",0
The hag fish was the first time I gagged. Oh geez.,0
I love how quickly Rhett's body rejected the hagfish gravy.,0
Yum!,0
Every day it gets more and more funny,0
WILL IT COOKBOOK? for the successful will its,1
"Huh, I was kind of expecting a Veterans Day episode. Oh well, thank you all of you mythical beasts that served!",0
OF COURSE DURIAN WILL ICE CREAM!!! HEY FELLOW INDONESIAN NICE TO SEE YOU!!,0
"I would watch an entire day worth of footage of Josh handling, and making all of the disgusting things for Rhett and Link to eat",0
I WOULD THINK VIKINGS USED IT OR SOMETHING LIKE IT,0
13:16 OMGGGGG,0
Links a weirdo,0
"That hagfish spit was worse than when Rhett tried swallowing the squid ink candy, and its hilarious.",0
"Rhett, I don't need smell-o-vision for that. It looks unpleasant, don't need to smell it.",0
WOW!!!!! Awesome job Link! I love the crew members being so happy Link got it down no problem! Was that Josh saying YEEESSS!!,0
Rhetts jumper is really confusing me,0
Rhett back at it again with his Kwanza shirt,0
You should make a good mythical cook book with all joshes good foods.,1
"Link, wow i'm impressed by you getting that slime down. Honestly didnt expect that. Congrats to you!",0
"Will it Syrup?
Will it Candy Cane?
Will it Pizza Roll?
Will it Milkshake?
Will it Cinnamon Roll?
Will it Underwear??
Just a few ideas;)",1
That's still not what a biscuit is!,0
"Pepperoni isnt Italian, its American. As far as meat goes Italians put Prosciutto, soppressata or salami on pizza.",0
How dare you make me watch you eat a full Thanksgiving dinner in front of my face. (Thanksgiving is my second favorite holiday because if I am at my dads house then my grandma cooks the best food ever and at my moms house she cooks the best food ever. Really it's a win win),0
"Psht.  Face like a hagfish.  ""Blow off, choffer.""",0
The Oreo is like the chocolate gravy my Mom made.,0
Gravy is disgusting  always has been to me always will be.,0
the oreo gravy is just basically chocolate gravy. if youre from the midwest you know what im talking about,0
"HEY MYTHICAL BEASTS! I just uploaded a vlog of going to the TOUR OF MYTHICALITY in Toronto! I included a bunch of clips from the show, check it out!",0
I regret eating breakfast while I watched them,0
Hey,0
"LINKS FACE WHEN HE SAYS ""IT MIGHT EVEN BE GOOD""... EPIC",0
Links scream at around 14:15 absolutely KILLS me,0
I wonder who cares a turkey at links house. Shouldn't be link,0
If you just film josh making these foods Id crowd fund,1
That hagfish slime was the grossest thing theyve done in awhile,0
You can hear how genuinely link doesn't like the hagfish gravy with how he yells no when they ask if it will,0
How are you two not dead or at the hospital all the time,0
That hagfish gravy goop looks like whats injected into a cow to make baby cows.,0
Still trying to not vomit.  I don't know how they didn't.,0
Gravy my biscuit. -Link,0
Will it cinnamon roll!!,0
Will it glass,0
"Dink it and sink it, but don't overthink it. <3",0
"What about ""will it not... ?"" New concept.",1
Shoulda done normal good brown english gravy,1
"Yeah... If I had smellavision, sadly I wouldn't be watching as religiously as I do!",0
Lets go Link! Way to eat the last one. One point for the Linkster,0
The pizza gravy is basically marinara sauce with pepperoni and cheese lol,0
Post a recipe for the pizza gravy please!?!?,1
"My grandmother used to stuff the turkey, but I'm from New Jersey, so perhaps therein lies the difference. Matter of fact, I enjoyed the stuffing that was roasted inside the bird better than the stuffing that was left out.",0
You guys should make a cook book.,1
It's called stuffing because we stuff it into the turkey,0
Will it soup?,0
"Take  60 % Veg Mayo Or Curd 
           20 % Tomato Ketchup  
           10 % Szechuan Chutney (Sauce) 
           5   % Indian Mango Pickle 
           5   % Veeba Pizza Sauce     <----- Not Sponsored XD 
MIX THIS ALL TOGETHER AND GET SOME CHIPS,FRIES WHATEVER YOU WANT TO DIP IN TO THIS AND FEEL THE TASTE.",0
11:32 December 1st.,0
"2:56 ""you're welcome world"". You guys do realize rest of the world do not celebrate your thanks giving?",0
Josh... please open a food truck on the weekends.  GMM EATS.  Lines around the block all day.,1
Will it gum?,0
"Oh no! Not Ros all day!
I work at Macys and once had to bag 3 pallets of Ros All Day gummies. It took me about a month to get through them all. 
Oh god!  Hag-(gags) fish gravy.
Well, I think thats a Will It? First: Rhett puked from the really nasty thing but Link didnt!",0
Of all the ways to take something off slinkily is just about the least arousing I can imagine,0
"one question
y tho?",0
I was trying to eat while watching them eat the glue-slime and I almost vomitted!,0
I never gagged watching one of your videos until that slime stuff,0
Link gets braver and braver and Rhett turns into more of a wiener all the time lol. Also 1420th episode. Woot woot!!!!!!!!!,0
"Will it fork, knife, spoon ?",0
Please bring back the game A Wig and A Name I want to see more Melvin and Willow...,1
"Ill be honest, I would eat the Oreo Gravy as a dessert on its own",0
1:03 weird flex but okay,0
2 Years ago I had a dream about this episode. And now its out. The magic is real. Must the the Oreo gravy getting to me,0
"this episode went from rhett (finally) inviting josh to his house to cook for him
to josh yelling ""oh my gosh! rhett!"" at a retching rhett.
i am jealous of that thanksgiving plate though.",0
the rose gravy looks like something that came out of my air compressor after running 24/7 and not being drained for 2 months.,0
Can you do will it latte? I think that would be really fun to do,1
I no longer desire breakfast. Great diet plan!  Rhett and Link ... Wet and shrink.  wait ...,0

Omg yessss. I really want some gravy now,0
Marshmallow in the potato? Is that a thing?,0
HES NOT GOING TO BE HUNGREY LATTER,0
"50 shades of gravy  I saw it coming!
I can't believe  Rhett just coughed up everything and Link actually swallowed it  
Link's little shake @ 13:23",0
Everyone's reaction to Link swallowing  the slime was hilarious! Everyone was so proud of him!,0
"I just keep replaying 13:15 over and over, and I'm enjoying every bit of it.",0
"Theres never a thanksgiving when my family doesnt inevitably fight about something stupid, so I think the alcohol gravy might not be a great choice lol",0
Will it will it? Collect loads of will it ideas and see if they make entertaining videos!,1
"thats horrible! 
but I feel arosed (   )",0
I WANT TO KNOW WHERE JOSH ENDS UP GOING ON THANKSGIVING dont leave me hanging guys,0
Thank you I accept  I love Josh,0
"I wish my family could get along for one day, my family refuses to get together anymore",0
Oh  my....almost lost breakfast....not sure if swallowing or spitting it out made my stomach turn. Nicely done....thanks for the laughs,0
I just had my first snow of the year. It's the middle of November..,0
Do will it Chicken Legs,1
I assume after the grey vomit josh is uninvited to your Thanksgiving ??,0
"Everyday Rett hates Link & his life, more & more. Just imagining all the different ways he could murder Link.",0
Noooooooooooooo!,0
The way Rhett's slime came out and landed looked so calm.,0
"Lol! Im literally wearing a shirt that says Rosa all day, and Link said Rosa all day",0
13:15 This might be the last video of GMM,0
Oreo gravy on ice cream would be amazing,0
"It would be fun to do an episode that taste compared Jelly Belly Bean Boozled flavors (earwax, earthworms, grass, vomit, etc) to the actual 'food' to see how accurate they are to the real thing. When I ate an earthworm jelly belly-it was awful-I thought, ""Wow! This really tastes like an earthworm!"" But does it?",1
We have a family recipe of chocolate gravy in my family that is so good! Not sure if other southern states make it but we sure do here in Kentucky!!!,0

"6:41: But Rhett, I'm NC born and raised too, and we called it both stuffing and dressing. And we did put it in the turkey to cook.",0
We made pizza gravy! So ummm... spaghetti sauce.,0
My nana made 'chocolate gravy' every year. It was literally watered down warm chocolate pudding but to the children in the room it was inchor of the gods.,0

"I wanna see a 'Will It Tea?'

WHAT? Link actually swallowed something nasty while Rhett spit it out? Dayum RESPECT!,0
"Being pregnant,  sometimes it's hard to watch episodes like this",0
"Link didnt want to poor Rhetts, he just wanted Rhett to poor his. So cute.",0
"Hey you guys, I'm going to be going overseas to help prevent human  trafficking in Nepal, click the link if you want to  find out more about it!httpsundme.com/amos-to-ywam",0
Always love the will it... videos,0
When r u going to do will it soda?,1
"Is there, or will there ever be, a GMM Recipe Book filled with all the creations we discovered work through all these episodes?",0
Thanks for adding Hagfish to my nightmare fuel.,0
Link is definitely drunk,0
12:43 : 13:18,0
Rhett rocking a 40's hairdo with little curls.,0
I actually dry heaved at the last food.,0
Link is an idiot,0
Anyone else a bit disappointed in the progress of the fund raising for St Jude,0
Cant wait to see Link during Mercury retrograde,0
"Okay, but Im seriously eating a whole sleeve of chips ahoy and I feel attacked.",0
Patiently waited for blood gravy and got hagfish slime instead. They never disappoint!,0
Watching Rhett dig around in the tub of hagfish slime and pull out lumps was distressing. But watching Link swallow that stuff was a triumph.,0
Yay Link!!! The Serpent King is victorious!!!,0
Anyone else just waiting for a Good Mythical Cookbook?,0
Rate fish sauces. Possibly while flying an ultralight or glider or in a hot air balloon so you can puke over the side.,0
"Idea:
WILL IT CALZONE!",1
My boyfriends a chef and loves hearing how you guys made the foods on your show. Dont worry if you feel like youre over explaining!,1
Was Link high during the filming of this?,0
Yung Gravy!,0
Oreo gravy... thats basically chocolate gravy which is already a thing in the south. Its more of a breakfast thing than a thanksgiving thing.,0
You should be thankful for veterans first and foremost.,1
That slime gravy just ejected itself from Rhett's mouth!,0
13:18 It leaves his mouth so fast!,0
Oh my god I want some Oreo gravy,0
Blood gravy?,0
"A little hole in the wall at the Tennessee/ Kentucky line has ""Chocolate gravy biscuits"" on their menu and they are a game changer.. best gravy biscuits you'll ever have",0
Can we hope for a GMM cooking book one day?,1
"Did I just hear gravy referred to as ""goo"" at the beginning there? Excuse me?",0
Dressing is my favorite,0
That was the first time I've seen Rhett put something in his mouth that he instantly vomited out. How did Link get it down?,0
"I really love ""will it episodes"" because I'm too poor to afford food. It helps with the hunger.",0
It can choke and kill its attacker. We're going to eat it!,0
Do will it chicken wing,1
"Honestly Im pretty done with them eating gross things, I say we get the boys to commentate others eating gross shit.",1
"So i have attention issues and frequently pause things to do other things, even if i am loving the primary thing XD Well i kinda forgot what was going on then just to end up hitting play on the video, having Link lean onto the table then go ""Well i am aroused"", I'm so scared XD",0
Where did josh choose to go for thanksgiving????,0
"Hey, what if you guys made, will it Revisited. Old will It ideas, like will it taco, but redone, with new flavors, and retrying old ones, it could be a hit shrug",1
"Link at 12:56 ""it might even be good""
*the stare of complete terror*",0
Oh goodness Rhett,0
"Will it chocolate milk?  As in, put the syrup or powder in various liquids and test them!",0
The episode I didn't know I wanted,0
i feel like rhett and link don't really like each other all that much anymore?,0
Get Gordon Ramsay as a guest in Will It,1
Prime opportunity missed to have Yung gravy on the show,0
Wow I'm impressed with how far Link has come eating gross stuff and getting it down,0
You guys have really made my morning. Its been kind of a bad one.,0
Do a will it turkey stuffing! Like different things you could stuff a turkey with,1
"I need a instant replay of Rhetts hack fish vomit

"Y'all should write a cooking book of the ""will-its"" that were a resounding ""yes!"".",1
I've watched you guys eat all kinds of nasty things and never once gagged. But seeing that hagfish slime? I almost couldn't continue. D:,0
13:11 - 13:18,0

"13:22-13:28... got it, NO I DONT, oh yes i do, NOPE ITS COMIN UP Link youre amazing lmao",0
"Omg I never get grossed out watching yall eat weird stuff. The hag fish slime was like seriously the most disgusting thing, had to look away. Im a nurse and it reminded me of the mucus secretions from a tracheotomy when it gets suctioned. So gross but still love the show!!!!",0
Grommit...,0
"Chocolate gravy is a thing here in KY, but I don't really like it. One of the few instances in life where chocolate isn't appropriate.",0
Will it Oreo?,0
I was fine until the end. I had a moment where I almost threw up for real and thats never happened before. Like I had breathe deeply. In through the nose out the mouth. These Will Its? are evolving. Yipes.,0
Thank you sir. It is called dressing when not stuffed.,0
Is it baked?is it fried?is is boiled? Guessing game...guess how the meat was cooked,0
"You did it, Serpent King!",0

I literally woke up this morning and said let it be a will it !,0
"Chocolate Gravy is actually a southern delicacy I grew up with. Butter, flour, milk, cocoa, vanilla. Serve it hot over biscuits and it is so delicious. It sort of tastes like a chocolate pie, but with a lot more crust, lol.",0
"Oh. Dear Rhett..so,so sorry",0
Oh my gosh,0
Will it cookie hag fish edition,0
Will it edible underwear?,0
I see Will It...I hit the like button,0
Finally,0
The oreo gravy reminds me of a recipe my great aunt makes. It's  chocolate gravy she makes by using a basic rue with butter. It's so good. Chocolate biscuits and gravy for the win!,0
Everyone thank Link for making gravy sound disgusting lmao !! We love Links definitions :-))),0
stuffing is called stuffing because it's all literally stuffed into the inside of the turkey.. lol,0
Sell. It,0

Poor hagfish... Disliked!,0
"Next week I have a Monitored EEG from the 19th to the 23rd at my neurology clinic, so I'm gonna be missing thanksgiving with my family this year. I'll have my laptop with me, so at least I will get to spend it with the GMM crew in spirit!",0
I'm so proud of Link for actually swallowing something.,0

Do Will It Poutine,1
"My aunt (rest her soul) used to make her traditional chocolate gravy on Sunday mornings - which we would put on our biscuits. Oreo gravy would not be too huge a departure - but I'm betting she'd of loved getting her mitts on that recipe. My Aunt was like Aunt Bea from Mayberry fame (Andy Griffith Show). Her hair, the way she dressed, and her quaint way of speaking.",0
Even seen every episode of GMM and that slime at the end was the worst thing Ive ever seen them eat. I couldnt even watch.,0
Do Will It Chocolate  Next Plz,1
"never in my life have i had such an aversion to the cheerios i was eating, until i witnessed the slime consumption",0

I went to the GMM tour of Mythically two days ago and I got the Book Of Mythically and I'm already on page 50 and I started to read it yesterday and I'm not a speed reader and the tour was amazing!!!!!!!!!

It really makes joy in my heart!! Have a great Thanksgiving!!!,1
Why do I feel like Rhett is always so annoyed by link?,0
Food Episode on. #IsItBetterWithAFriedEggOnTop,0
Link wasn't the one who puked? Am I watching the right channel?,0
Have you noticed how the show has become a bit inappropriate with the jokes,0
They are not having thanksgiving together,0
I saw you guys in person at the show in ct and it just made me love you guys even more,0
9:38... did Rhett swear?,0
"Did Link just admit to smothering children? or covering them in gravy? either way, where is the NSA",0
NICE,0
You know you couldve bought double stuffed Oreos and would of only had to of used 34 Oreo guts. Oreo Lives Matter OLM,1
U can tell tht indonesian guy enjoys tht ice cream and its not a big of a deal for him,0
Oklahoma we eat chocolate gravy . So Oreo gravy sounds great.,0
"Would you please give Josh a cooking show? He's talented, funny, creates interesting recipes, and he is easy on the eyes. Or maybe have him publish a GMM cookbook? Thanks!",1
Great video guys!,0
Seeing them live was amazing Saturday. Would definitely recommend seeing them if they come to your state next tour,1

"They have raised a lot of money for St. Jude's. It's so important because medical bills, especially those related to long term illness, can bankrupt you. I got sick for a few years and it bankrupted me. I'm just now getting back on my feet. I don't know how I would handle it if my son got sick.",0

"I dunno how I only found you recently, but I love all things R&L and all things Mythical!!!",0
That half fish looks like lemonade,0
Rhett looked like he was having a stroke during the prologue.,0
That Oreo Garvey looks soo nice now I'm hungry for that,0
Omg... I've never gagged watching you. But I just gagged multiple times watching you pour the hag fish slime on that delicious turkey dinner.,0
I wanna eat that oreo gravy,0

So close to vomiting with the last one eeeewwwwww,0
"rhett ""that is absolutely horrible!'

"I wasn't even there and I almost threw up during that hagfish segment. I don't want smell-ivision , please no, it's gonna make it even worse",0
random question. Why are their new videos always coming out at 3am?,0
yeah i think saying DRESSING is an east-coast/midwest thing because in ohio we  NEVER  stuff the turkey we just eat it as a side so we call it dressing,0
"I love these ""will it"" videos on of the reasons I tune in",0
LAST,0
I love how there so oblivious makes me proud,0
"HAHAHA when Link showed us his edible underwear, i laughed so hard i began to cry :')",0
"Dear Lord I just experienced taste of vision -I was eating dinner -stew -and I saw the slime gravy -my mind did the rest, mixed with Rhetts and Links sounds Im still feeling sick",0
If it ain't smothered in something which is the way that I love my children Rhett you seemed so disappointed in life XD,0
"Mmm nothing like snot potatoes to start the day. Thats looked horrible, and you guys are  insane, but I love you.",0
12:23 it looks like mucus hehe,0
We used to have chocolate gravy and biscuits every Christmas morning.,0
"Have you done a will it burrito yet? I cannot remember, but have personally found most anything will, whether it's hotdogs, breakfast, lasagna (Italian seasoned meat, mozzarella,  tomato if you like those)...where could it go wrong.",0
I still want to see an episode where you can convince Link that tomato's are tasty.,1
"I know you are doing the Thanksgiving food cause its Nov, but next time you do a WILL IT GRAVY I would stick to just pouring on biscuits. Like gravy and biscuits. I think all of these would have been better like that. Yum. I want some oreo gravy on biscuits rn lol",1

"Let me bore you with this unexciting fact...we Koreans don't eat the slimy part but we eat the meat part, because they are basically eel-like fish. Grilled fish.",0

Will it episodes basically mean that someone is going to barf at some point and you know not to eat while watching. It was going so well until.....it wasnt. Lol super proud of Link too :) :),0
First time Link ate something super nasty without throwing it up.,0
Have y'all never had biscuts and chocolate gravy?! That was a staple of my entire dad's family.,0

So video games are not acceptable but real life war and genocide of invading other lands taking other rights and lives is ok??  Sure,0
"its funny how these people say video games make people violent  yet the never talk about the rating and try to make them look bad. 
and so i disliked the video.",0
Wth? When their heads come off in cod it is cartoony. The body goes flying a few feet and the head just disappears.,0
Ben Shapiro destroying libtards with facts and logic.,0
You fools you dont list the benefits because you just want to go against fun,0
MURDERER PLAYS VIOLENCE  GAME CAUSES VIOLENCE! hmm maybe He is violent And THAT is why he plays that. 2:34 he is literally playing super smash bros brawl,0
the tangerine with tall grass speaks the truth,0
No.,0
"Math causes more violence than video games, its used to create formulas for nuclear weapons",0
"When I see ninja rage, that makes me think",0
"I think the
Like/Dislikr ratio speaks for itself",0
0:56 they should've brought a game developer,1
BTW imagine Fox news looking at these comments and seeing 11 THOUSAND DISLIKES!!!,0
"Yeah, playing crossy road made me want to run over a chicken with a car.",0
"Person:Ya sure let's not worry about very violent movies like saving Private Ryan no no no no we should worry about this call of duty thing
Me: You dumb f*ck, you have no right to complain if you're not going to complain about it's older brother",0
"Well my limits for kids is to play shooter games is like 11 or 10 and up and I believe that every can play games but I think these people who say video games are evil, they can have no say about it unless the played and those shooter video games, people more like play them for competitive reasons",0
No,0
he's right after I play earthbound I want to hit dogs with a baseball bat and set them on fire,0
Shouldn't he be in the basement bringing dead cats back to life?,0
Ben Shapiro is covering up because he HIMSELF is a gamer.,0
You can tell youre doing it wrkng when theres 10k more dislikes than likes,0
Just watching the gameplay while the military staff talks LOL.,0
"So we're going to restrict personal freedoms and liberties for the populous because of unfounded claims and feelings?
And I just got done with a 2 hour survival session on Hatred.",0
"Oh wow video games seem really dangerous and harmful to me. Welp, I guess I'll go snort coke instead!",0
Ben shapiro talks too fast,0
I play Kirby but that doesnt make me want to commit genocide,0
"So Trump failed as a father too. 
Useless idiot.",0
Short answer: NO Im sorry Donald Trump Im on youre side with most politics but video games dont make you violent only if you have an unstable mind. Video games are like a relief to me when im angry I just shoot a bunch of people ON GTA 5 NOT IRL and I calm down. It really helps me,0
Why am I getting shivers when I watch this?,0
So me playing Pokemon Sun and Moon all the time means I am now qualified to take care mystical creatures?,0
School shooters also train with real guns...I guess there goes the 2nd Amendment right?,0
"I used to watch my brother play these types of game since I was six. I got my first assassins creed game when I was 12 and I played it everyday. Not that I craved violence, I just found it intriguing. The whole story was so different from what I was used to and I do things in those games that I think that whoever did them should be sent to hell for. I would never, EVER do any of the acts shown in these video games in my life! Take it from me, a 15 year old. (I rlly didnt wanna add this but I kinda thought it would make my point larger while cringing while Im typing because peeps might think Im a gamer girl no Im a person who plays games. I dont play the overwatches and the calls of thy duties but, red dead redemption 2 is my favorite at the moment)",0
Fox news chill out just because someone killed someone that somehow video games get blamed for it. So they are literally saying if i pop out my old N64 and play mario party i will become john Wayne gancy? This ain't it chief!,0
I play violence video games but Im not going around killing people,0
No,0
This motherfuckers eyes got shrunk of the mii editor,0
If only there was a rating on every video game box...,0
It's not working stop wasting money.   don't numb your minds watching this.          iff anything your making it worse,1
I have been playing far cry 5 and now i want to start a cult.,0
The kids who shot up the school didn't do it because of video games they did it because there mental.,0
Ive been playing games for 12+ years and the most violent crime ive committed is running a red light,0
But why dont theses things happens in other countries,0
"3:36, Stephen Breyers is lying. I can confirm as a fact this is false.",0
Ben Shapiro my man.,0
Well actually its not the game makers fault some games have recommended ages and if they want to become violent it is there own choice,0
No,0
"Playing Phoenix Wright doesnt make me an attorney.
Playing sim city doesnt make me an architect.
So why would playing violent games make me a murderer?",0
Dude why did they have Super Smash Bros.,0
"Did he say movies?! 
Did she say there's no such thing that girl gamers?!
Did they say little kids watch bloody stuff guts blood?!
The people  say games are violent and they watch Looney Tunes and Tom and Jerry 
This is what makes me violent watching people think video games are violent this is making me violets",0
With the amount of FIFA I've played over the years I'm practically the next Messi now.,0
Stupid orange niglet trump,0
"My mother has shown me this video and many others like this and she always leans on the unhealthy part but then again with that she also shows me many videos about stranger danger, street violence and general bad things that have happened in public and forbids me to leave the house. So anyone got anything better to do when your locked in your own house.",0
let them look up Killing floor 2,0
"Sorry, but what about violent books and movies and shows that are very, very violent.  Seriously, so many people play video games. Reassess your data.",0
Fox shut your ass up your trying to get are parents to look at this and take it away. Also females also play and it doesnt increase violence. look at my brother he play call of duty and FPS games and he was in the Marines and now he is a cop and still play video games and its are property that we pay or parents pay and know youre saying that its gone increases the percentage on teen using drugs fox you can go to hell.,0
"yes games lead to violence, i have been abused by my family my entire life, been bullied by everyone at my school, had access to guns in my garage, became heavily addicted to meth and i constantly feel alone in the world. yet it was roblox mcdonalds tycoon that led me to the violent ways that i live by today... LOGIC",0
Wow then this means that Spider-Man ps4 makes me a web slinging ninja-like white male who can break the laws of physics with thin lines of webbing,0
If everyone played video games we wouldnt need an army because everyone would be putting their anger on the game instead of real life,0
At least trump didnt just target video games like most media,0
Guys Im really confused Im literally shaking rn how was there violence before video games?????? OMG Im freaking out!!!,0
"So its not ok to play a video game about shooting someone, but its ok to have the news show footage of a bank robbery?",0
I wish there was a middle finger button,0
Hell ya played some fortnite and now i am building like crazy in real life,0
I am conserverative but this is just crazy video game don't affect violence,0
you said cartoon arent violent! watch attack on titans first than talk about violince,0
"Hey,Fox News....The 11k dislikes are from the gamer community,just let that sink in.",0
Dipshits.,0
"I played super smash bros:
Now I'm a pig molestor.",0
This is fox news you really think you can believe this?,0
"Games are fun little kids play minecraft, older kids beat the crap out of the people who wants shooting games banned Black ops 4 is the best. Go home get a console and play a vilote game it's amazing.",0
"If i had an obsession with the idea of killing people, of course i would jump at the opportunity of a realistic simulation of killing people. So of course people who have a killing obsession would love violent videogames. It is correlation not causation. If you're concerned about how young the kids are then follow the age ratings provided on the boxes that are designed to prevent damage to more impressionable kids. Easy stuff.",0
Ideots,0
My Neighbor is in Army.He Still in Training.But He Plays A lot Of Violent Videogames And Many More.But He Never Have Violence issue Like Killing People in Real Life.And Still Playing Violent Videogames Even He Still in The Army.,0
,0
Such realistic violence. You know most studys around this are false and mostly are bribed,0
Well at least Ben shapiero is here,0
I play Minecraft. Now I can punch tress to get woods,0
blaming violent on video games is like blaming gun violent on squirt guns,0
"I've been playing Gta since I was a kid.
Now I'm 20 yo, and I never even once held a GUN.",0
Ben sheparo trolling libtards,0
"by playing gta you turn into a killer. You see what people think? You play a shooter game and they will become a killer they say without any evidence.Its not a good choice to let a 8 year old to play gta or mortal kombat to not show them images that arent okay for their age. They should be older to play those . BUT if by any chance they DO play them , they arent going to turn into heartless killers.",1
I think the parents or kids should read the big M or T rating on the box of the game before blaming video games for being violent,1
It sounds like they're blaming the kids who cant buy these games for themselves instead of the weak willed parents who can't control their own kids.,0
3:11 she realized she was proven wrong and immediately switched the conversation.,0
"After playing Mario, I feel like jumping on a turtle. 
Totally not sarcastic",0
"For 1: that's why games are raided M for mutual 
For 2: the games so called violence is cartoon-y and that's why street fighter and smash bros are for kids
And for 3: why are you teaching war in school the place that kids have to go to by law",0
No...  goodnight everyone,0
yes,0
This guys hair is very similar to hitlers IDK,0
Hey guys its true all murders eat apples so apples must cause violence see how stupid that is its the same thing as saying video games cause violence because murders have played them video games dont cause violence,0
Hey guys its true all murders eat apples so apples must cause violence see how stupid that is its the same thing as saying video games cause violence because murders have played them video games dont cause violence,0
"Video games are meant to be played and to make people have fun in a world with no consequences. Even if people take violent video games seriously, it will only be a few people. And people should know these violent games arent real. 
Also why the hell would people use games to train soldiers!?",1
maybe don't let parents let their kids get guns in their home or go buy one just keep a eye on your child you should't get a  kid if you are not a responsible person,1
Here we go again.,0
this is like blaming car crashes on the bumper cars,0

"BEN SHAPIRO 
WHAT A MAD LAD!!!",0
Blow me Fox,0
I play call of duty so Im gonna get shipped to military school?,0
Ben Shapiro is the only sane one.,0
ben shapiro saves the day,0
"ok this video is not about the political left or right, its about the oppression of gamers and non-gamers",0
"If I play surgeon simulator: I do not become a surgeon.
If I play Street Fighter: I do not become a skilled martial artist.
If I play Rainbow Six Siege: I do not become a trained member of a counter terrorism unit.
If I play Uncharted: I do not become a skilled treasure hunter. 
The only way there can be a correlation, even in the slighest, is if the person is extremely immature, or in immense negative state of mind.",0
I love GTA,0
For once i agree with ben shapiro,0
"Ok,  shut up",0
You know its funny how the stereotype is that gamers have no life and are introverted losers that are weak and dont want to go outside. Yet were also the most dangerous people on the planet apparently,0
"M meansmiture
T means teen
E means everyone 
READ IT",0
My only problem about this is history says nothing about video games causing all those wars and genocides. what was the reason then?,0
"If he spent 15 hours a day playing games, how did he go to school?",0
"Playing guitar hero doesnt make me a professional guitarist
Playing fifa doesnt make me a professional football player
Playing forza doesnt make me a professional race cardriver
Playing gta makes me a relentless killer and a criminal
I dont see the logic, could someone explain?",0
"It's not that video games make violent people, it's that violent people also happen to also play video games.",0
Here are the video game talks again. Didnt they learn from the MK controversy?,0
No. OBVIOSLY.,0
"They don't even know the names of the games or have even played them, yet, they're ""experts.""
I really hope our military doesn't have the same level of training as a 16 year old emoting and dabbing after parashooting out of a balloon powered bus after taking A site and spray painting CT Spawn",0
I love watching stupid ass ignorants/hypocrites everyday!,0
Didnt they also practice shooting with the real guns they bought?,0
"I played Wii party babies
Now I want to go berserk and massacre everyone I know",0
My niggas Ben shapiro,0
"Video games are violent?
Coming from Fox news and Trump.",0
Ben Shapiro DESTROYS morality with FACTS and LOGIC,0
Destroyed with facts and logic,0
"Ok ok I wish people understood that a lot of gamers that play violent games is just to have a fun hobby every one likes something and violence does not equal games, as well as that theres something called a age rating parents just need to do research on the game before buy it when I was younger my parents would only allow me to buy t for teen games and now I understand everything",1
I love Ben even more now!,0
"former military dude says these ""simulators make people violent"" ... hmm the same simulators the military trains with? lmao!",0
0:21 yeah Trump like you never spend your time on Twitter the internet's oh boy,0
50 hours a day,0
the internet stuff 200iq,0
yo its legit i just got done playing mario kart and have the sudden urge to drive akrts and throw turtles at people,0
I can't believe I'm a violent killer for playing harvest moon and animal crossing!,0
what about all the violence that FOX tv shows produce ????????????,0
Correlation does not equal causation,0
Wonder what they are gonna say about Mk 11,0
Bullying. School shootings. Most acts of violence are from being bullied and from bad pasts. The last time a school shooting wad encouraged by a video game wad back in the 1990s. The game Doom was so quote on quote violent it made someone want to shoot up a school. Kids have common sense like me. We know that we shouldnt resort to violence. Ban idiots not video games. End of argument.,1
president trump says fake news,0
the second i saw the video i knew the dislikes would outnumber the likes by far.,0
Ben Shapiro saves the day,0
Ben Shapiro believes it is immoral to play video games. What?,0
"Playing cuphead, though frustrating, doesn't make me want to shoot up my local flowershop",0
"if it causes violence, then playing any Tom Clancy game makes me a tactical genius.",0
"Yeah but it doesnt lead to actual real life violence, people just blame video games instead of the parents or the person. And trump said that kids are watching.... Kids...... CALL OF DUTY IS FOR ADULTS",0
I love how there's only 2 series that they bring up which are always GTA and CoD,0
Fuk you trump your nothing being the president,0
"Kid plays gta once 
There minds: oh well there goes billy with a ak shooting some pedestrians",0
"Yeah, when i imagine war i totally imagine someone pushing a bomb car 1000000 miles more than needed, someone double jumping, someone jumping to gain speed like a bunny, Counter-Terrorist forces needing to buy their own weapons. Totally.
This post was made by Ben Shapiro gang",0
I like how they interviewed someone who clearly hasn't played a single video game in his entire life.,0
There's a reason that violent video games are rated M you know...,0
"ITS RATED M, IF YOU THINK YOUR KIDS SHOULDNT BE PLAYING THEM, YOU SHOULD BE CONTROLLING WHAT MEDIA YOUR CHILDREN ARE PLAYING!",1
"It's 2018 and they are showing the trailer for COD bo3, oh Zeus end us now.",0
Well Im just happy that trump didnt say just video games. Pisses me off when people ignore movies and tv,0
"That author cites a guy who played shoot 'em up games 15 hours a day, which is a VERY extreme example. Doesn't help his case.",0
Ben Shapiro put those old farts their place,0
The anchor pisses me off.,0
"2:12 sorry but that's really sexist I'm a girl and I play video games! 
And sorry but games barely a link to violence!
Isn't it obvious go search it up and there's so much Scientific proof proving you wrong!
So actually do your research before you go around saying video games make kids violent! 
Like if you agree!",0
By the same logic I play an MMORPG therefore I must be prone to dressing up as a wizard and seriously trying to cast wind strike on chickens.,0
Maybe if parents paid more attention to their children we would not have so many school shootings. Not okay for kids to play video games but its totally okay for parents to spend most of their time on social media.,0
I thought trump hated faked news?,0
Y did u use smash bros gameplay wtf,0
"So I played Formula One... 
I MUST BE A MURDERER/RACER",0
fox news you dont make any sense use your head for once and stop its annoying,1
Ugh you cant say just because most violent people play violent games then video games make violence. You have to look at everyone that plays these games and see how many people become violent. Correlation doesn't equal causation!,0
1:24 Adam Lanza never existed though! I thought everyone knows that Sandy Hook was a hoax.,0
report this video right noww,1
I am now a licensed Surgeon after playing Surgeon Simulator!,0

"I am no Fox news fan, I'm not a fan of any of the major news media as I find a lot I don't agree with all of them. What I don't understand is why do so many people love watching the extreme violence? It's not just kids. I use to love super hero TV shows back when the good guy won without as much killing. Now, I read so many comments people that love all the violence that the bad guy/guys do. What's with that? I am not trying to be critical. I just really don't understand. Not when I was a child, not as an adult have I ever loved watching a lot of violence and always rooted for the good guy and never the bad guy. Now, it seems the more killings the bad guy does before he or she finally gets stopped the better the viewers like it.",0

I've been playing games for 13 years and not once have I been inclined to violence related to them. If I do happen to let my mind rest upon a violent act, it's something I witnessed another doing or something someone did in a movie. I play the games, I know what buttons I press to get kills; Left-Click and R1, who in their right mind could develop violent tendencies from controller interactions? ""Hell yea I clicked him real good."" Tbh Wii boxing had more of an effect on me in that regard than any call of duty or gore heavy game.

Also why do they only show clips of cod bo3? And what did they check 20 seconds of research, it's easily to know because she says ""video games are a boy thing"" obvious sign she doesn't understand anything she's talking about, also no one uses video games to help teach for military, the closest thing that they could do is use VR, which doesn't even have the recoil of an actual weapon and the noise. Also if your playing video games, the technology just isn't ere yet to actually show real life visuals of someone's heads exploding, it's usually pixelated because the games are already rendering so much, it can't have that show up perfectly. And parent should actually do their job and monitor what their kids are doing because if their kid is 8 years old and hears rumors about a really popular game that is AO, and his parents buy him it anyway, that is their fault you can't blame it on the child, and finally these mass shooters can't be blamed for playing GTA V and then going out and shooting up the neighborhood, that's not the video games fault, that's a mental issue they might have had

Protect your kids from drinking rum and smoking weed thats more bad for them,1
"First it was movies that hurt childrens brains and made them violent, then it was comic books then it was rock and roll then it was rap/ hip hop parents just wanna blame someone else so they dont have to face the fact that they suck at raising there kids",0

"Well i play mario, and never once have i had the urge to go jump on a turtle. Point being, I T S  J U S T  A  G A M E. Calm down. I play COD, and never once have i gone and gunned someone down. Obviously, news channels do this for attention. It makes them money. Like, if video games are so bad, what about movies? They're pretty violent. You're complaining about video games, and yet you left a huge global warming mess for us teens/kids to clean up, but oh no. Its the video games. I just dont get it. Its the same with esports. People make fun of gamers for watching esports because its ""just a game"". Isnt football a game? Soccer? Hockey? And yet you go crazy for it. But when it comes to video games, its ""just a game"". I truly do not understand the news outlets bias against video games. Just stay off our case, talk about something more important, like ISIS, or IRL violece.
Sincerely,
A fellow gamer.",0

Nope played violence games and I never killed anyone,0
Because it wouldn't be the NRA's fault now would it?,0
I'm writing a paper on video games and looking at different articles and stuff and all I want to say is that parents can see if a video game is violent or not without knowing anything about the game. Every game has a rating from E for everyone to M for mature.  If you're a parent that wouldn't want your kids to watch a rated R movie then just look at the game's rating before you buy it for them. That's a really easy solution.,0
Bullshit,0
no,0
"Me: (reads title) oh boy am expecting a lot of likes on the video and negative comments on games. 
Me: (looks at dislikes and comments)...well that backfired didn't FOX.",0
"Gaming is just one factor of these crimes. you have mental problems, life problems, seeking of attention, and mostly aggression over someone. People just choose gaming as it is the easiest factor to blame it on and it attacks every gamer out there. Not just gamers either, those who watch movies, listen to music, or even reading books! The media uses gaming to make a good story and ends up just frustrating gamers. Let's use this philosophy with the Bible... It holds violence in it with David hitting Goliath with a slingshot and Jesus being nailed to a cross. Why don't we ban the bible and churches for this then? It does the exact same thing to people but is praised by many. Do you know why they don't ban it? Because violence in media don't cause violence. it is the people with their own problems or factors encouraging them.",0

"Yes, I am playing a shooting game. I suddenly feel like getting an AK and mowing down a crowd. Makes sense.

Shootings have gone down over the future we just have better tech to track more,0
Well i guess this means i can   exposes the government for murdering a small central American town's inhabitants to cover up zombies and defeat a U.S Special forces comander in hand to hand combat because i played Dead Rising.,0
If video games did this to people Gun violence would be through the roof in Japan.,0

They rigged this debate. They got a vet that knows nothing about games and a person who thinks they are immoral. When he says he doesn't believe video games cause violence but think they are immoral it basically invalidated anything he had to say in people's eyes who are ignorant of the topic.,0

"There is some violence in video games, but that doesn't mean all people get a gun and start to shoot everyone. Also, I am tired of you talking about the bad stuff about gaming while leaving the good stuff behind. Even if you're 70 years old, you can still play video games. I'm not trying to mock you because you don't like video games, I'm just saying you're convincing parents to make their kids stop playing their game.",0

"So according to Fox News and stupid braindead Conservatives, I should be one of the world's top fighters because I play Tekken. I can beat virtually anybody in a real life one on one fight because I play Tekken. Video games may affect kids, but it starts at home. When the parents see little Billy or Mary Sue playing Mortal Kombat or Halo and they're starting to turn violent on them. Maybe instead of being scared of your own kids or spoiling them, be a damn parent and tell your kids what's up and punish them. Take things away from them that they cherish the most for like a week or 2. The main problem isn't games, it's these parents ain't shit these days and that's why you have things called Whoa Vicky, Lil Tay and Bhad Bhabie running around. Be there for your kids, love them. Make them feel special and loved and discipline them when they step out of line. If they feel hurt, angry or sad about something and they need someone to have an open mind and open ears, listen to them. Have a talk to them It's that simple. This proves people like Donald Trump, Conservatives and Fox News don't really represent a ""Non PC/Anti-SJWs"" group of people. They're also apart of the problem that they love to preach against. It's not musical artists, video game companies, and Hollywood to teach YOUR children from right and wrong, it's YOUR job as parents. Sub-Zero, Chun-Li, The Master Chief, Supergirl, Kim Kardashian, Kanye West, Batman etc. isn't your kid's parents, YOU are as the parent! This is one of THE main reasons towards why entertainment sucks today because retards in this video (excluding Ben Shapiro) bitching about it and watering it down and Hollywood, the gaming industry, musical artists listens to them and do what THEY say.",1
Ben is always a down to the facts guys. This is why I love listening to him.,0

"Yes, dude plays Call of Duty and then goes: ""Im ready"". Then steps out of his house, goes to a gun shop, buys shit tons of weapons -- because HEY, America will sell guns to psychos -- then goes around murdering people but FOX News and politicians blame VIDEO GAMES on the violence?! Not the fact that guns are so easily to buy? Because pressing R2 on the controller is the same as pulling an actual trigger on a machine gun?
Man, America... keep coming up with excuses to defend gun ownership. Psycho conservatives!",0
If you've seen some of those gang vidoes where someone's head really gets blown of you'll understand it is a very different feeling to a game,0

Not all involve killing in general or killing innocent people. News flash, you can be physically active & play videogames. We need to stop blaming everything. The criminals themselves are accountable. Stop shifting the blame on music, videogames, movies etc.",1

I think it may be true that violent people tend to play violent video games. But that doesn't mean that violent video games produces violent crime as the older guy is saying. That's the problem with his whole argument. Instead of video games making people violent it's more likely that people who are already violent just like to play violent video games.

I mean if all you're doing all day is playing videogames alone (which is increasingly uncommon due to online gaming), and you have little to no social interaction and you never work to better yourself then yes, you're more likely to be an extremely bitter, resentful, angry person envious of everyone else and you're probably more likely to end up blowing up a school.

You cant practice aim on video games Ive shot b a bow and arrow many times before and Im pretty accurate but in a video game it doesnt require strength or holding your breath or wind or drop or your fingers starting to hurt. I know that there are games like tf2 where you have to worry about drop but real life and video games are completely different and I also know that guns and bows are completely different but you still cant train with a gun using video games because theres different things to worry about,0

My Answer: Video games don't link to real life violence unless you committed a crime.
your actual answer is Yes but NO! because not all video games like BF1,CS:GO and Call of duty are for only peoples who really want to play those games and ignore all news like that
if you are actual hating on the game go hate other games because you will get even more dislikes than likes

You know instead of blaming the games themselves for little kids who play them. Why don't we blame the parents that are too lazy to be a proper parent  and can't be arsed to stop their kids from playing them them selves?

First of there are millions of little boys as well as some girls growing up playing these games and they turned out fine as far as gta I dont see soldiers playing these games their is a difference between simulators and games their is equivocal evidence shown that jet packs and robot soldiers dont exist on a daily in modern war not just that its more of a individual problem and the environment theyd shooter are around as well as their mental background the fact that violent crime is down means that their is less of an issue on games and more of a moral issue,0

Idek what game they are talking about when it comes to heads exploding and chests opening up. Maybe gore horror games but that's a minority of gamers and its still not as realisticly looking as movies that everyone watches. Cod doesnt really have much violence since there is barely any blood .and gta is the midline of brutality but its not like millions are running people over in the streets daily like we do in gta (dont lie youve done it),0

"I partly agree with Ben Shapiro Stand on this topic, I believe that this is up to the parent.  I personal do not believe that video games make individuals violent.  I do believe though that video game may distract others and create a shorter attention span since individuals are engaged within a fast paced environment.  The reason why, I agree with Ben Shapiro on this topic is because I do believe it is up to the parent to decide on what they want to be giving their child.  From a personal experience I remember going into Game Stop and trying to buy a game that was rated M when I was 12 and the cashier wouldn't sell to me because I wasn't old enough.  My parents would also not buy me the game so I do feel like it is should be up to the parent.",0

But the people at Fox news and most of the public think books don't cause violence? Next time research the topic before you all blame video games.",1
3:40 then why dont they bring n a medical expert?,0
They use these to train military? Fuck off. I guess I should race professionally because I play Forza. Ben Shapiro is well-researched as he always is. Almost all studies show that videogames have no effect on violence because suprise these teens can tell the difference between online and real life. Fortnite is barely violent at all.

"Smh, can't believe how many times this subject has been brought up. JUST LET IT GO!!!",1
"simple answer:
yes i have got back from my EVIL tea drinking whitch somehow causes a disaster",0
Killing is soo funny :D,0
"All people who play call of duty(any shooters)are psychopaths, this news report is dumb. Alright! I'll teach you how to be not a psycopath:
1.dont play call of duty
2.play outside or nintendo
 But one thing how about old cartoons there violent maybe one of these adults somehow watched a violent cartoon.",0
The dislike ratio is so gooood.,0
they do know these games have ratings and you have to be a certain age to purchase them so it is parenting but the kids cant buy  them until they are 17 or 18 depending on the state.,0
Of course its shit Fox News,0
"This was one of the least productive and progressive conversations on video game violence I've heard so far. If y'all think video games should be highly controlled or even banned, then maybe we should ban media outlets from filling our societies brains with bullshit as well.",1
"Ah man, if only Hitler just didn't play Wolfenstein.
I didn't make this joke, I just copied it.",0
600 liks7k dislikes,0
"First of all those games are 18+ so its parents fault second you  retarded ape get some sense into yourself if you have that kind of logic than that means people couldnt have children if they didnt watch porn, if you say that it can be thought then killing can be thougth as well you idiot, just by saying he will not live if you stab a knife into person .",0
You can't buy a violent video game unless your 17....what the fuck is their point? It's already regulated and you're not gonna stop parents from buying games for their kids.,0
Shut the fuck up,0
"Heads exploding? Chests exploding?? I never saw any game like that. Ive played Ark, UFC, Boxing, COD, Battlefield, Fortnite, and PLENTY of other games and NONE of them look all that realistic...",0
All the school shooters they mentioned played video games just like everybody else. Man I dont know anyone who doesnt play video games.,0
Okay trustworthy Fox News,0
"Not my case. If I wasnt into videogames I actually would've probably have stds, be into drugs, be an alcoholic and not have completed my degree in college. Video games were the only reason why it stopped me from doing all those things. TBH Im so greatful for my  ps4 and my old ps3/ps2. Now I have a happy life, a degree, a good job and a beautiful gf. Thank you videogames for helping me stress out when I needed you the most!",0
"We have a violent country, gta, mma, its like Rome with the gladiators, people see blood they want more.",0
"The answer is simple.
No.
If there is so much violence, well heak maybe you should buckle down and be a parent for once hu~?",1
Kill gaming kill a 100 billion dollar industry and destroy the work oppirtunies of hundreds of thousands,0
"Bout 20 of 1,8 billion have made a mass murder and so everyone is a violent psycho",0
yeah fucking every single one of hunderds of millions  of gamers world wide are going to make a homicide,0
So sexism and blatant lies is what makes up fox now.,0
Well the very violent and gore filled games are 18+ and should not be played by these kids so its the parents fault not the game developers fault,0
Ooooooooooo now this is fake news these people have done no reaserch at aaaalllll all video games can be violent like the legend of Zelda my fav game series but those are monsters your killing but video games= vilonce wrong idiots,0
"Whether constitutional or not constitutional...
The same could be said about gun control.",0
These are just biased opinions with very specific circumstances and stupid people who think they know something.,0
Ban video game more like ban movies,1
Erric Harris and Dylan Klebold didn't shoot up Columbine because they played violent video games.,0
This is just stupid. Feminism and some old fuck who couldn't find Chrome browser on a laptop,0
Truth is that they do cause violence. Just killed everyone in my neighborhood.,0
That gameplay was fye af,0
"If I compare my rainbow 6 stats to real life, id be a terrible school shooter.",0
"Does watching Fox News make you retarded? Yes, yes it does.",0
No thank you I would rather play CoD than Barbie Adventures,0
5:09 All players must be from Murica or its bad for your children.,0
SSB LUL,0
"Most all youth play violent video games nowadays, the fact that mass murdering youth did too means nothing. Also, why do we not talk about other forms of media as well? Video games are always the scapegoat.",0
I played Cooking Mama. I'm better chef than Gordan Ramsay.,0
"I'm sure all of these shooters ate ice cream at one time. Therefore, ice cream causes mass shooting.",0
Except Ben sharpiro they were very biased,0
"I will use their own idiotic thoughts and show you how idiotic this is
This is an example of what they are saying.
""All mass shooters wear sneakers so it must be the sneakers"" 
Your point is stupid",0
"points finger on videogames but not on controlling buying guns, old people are so pathetic. it's 2nd ammendment's fault why there're school shootings not videogames",0
Oh im violint oh so let me buy a gun and shoot up and orphanage teach those fuckers a lesson sorry ur mum and dad didn't luv u or r dead,0
"They are making a rant about games with no INTELLIGENCE about them...
You should have at least one month of LEARNING the thing you're making a rant about.
Not just going willy nilly, ranting on a game with no intelligence.",1
"you know its funny when they talk about how liberal celebrities are out of touch when they talk about poor people and poverty, but then they say shit like this and expect not to be called hypocritical douchebags",0
"I like to play allot of first person shooters, but I agree that grand theft auto is unexceptable",0
"yeah, sorry but shapiro is right. Violent crime is the lowest that it has ever been. Don't rely on how much you see it on the news and, consequently, how easily you can recall it (availability heuristic). Look at the actual statistics. While it is true that many studies have discovered a strong correlation (and some even a causation via experimental random selection), it is also true that studies have found NO LONG TERM effect. So, to draw an inappropriate comparison: a child watching a sex scene will undoubtedly get more horny in the time immediately after watching, but in the long run will be no more horny than any other pubescent adolescent or post-pubescent adult.",0
"On an unrelated note, the new God of War is looking pretty sick.",0
1.2 billion people play video games worldwide NO SHIT SOME PHYSCOS ARE GONNA PLAY EM,0
Came for the dislikes,0
Fuck you all the only country that has this problem is the us why don't you take peoples guns away instead of targeting video games you fucks,0
Theres a correlation between all shooters who play video games its that almost every guy plays video games and only like 1% actually kill people,0
aaaand dislike :D,0
Where we droppin bois,0
"I play assassins creed, only thing it makes me wanna do is climb buildings tbh",0

"If video games work as training, why aren't we sending gamers to fight terrorists when they have been ""training"" for decades?",0
So I guess all those third world militias and military dictorships are the result of too much MW2?,0
"Trump: ""I look at some of the things my son watches, and I wonder how that's possible.""
Me: "" Because you let him. """,0
If you put a ficking law on video games i fucking guarantee you that it wont go over well.,0
"It honestly depends on the person, i have been playing violent games since elementary school and i guarantee that i am more sane and more mature than most people my age",0
Does this mean that I can become a basketball player by playing NBA?,0
They dont fucking use video games to train in the military,0
At least they good vids from real good gamers. man those frags are dope af,0
There are rating systems for these for a long time wtf. Educate the parents about these games and as Shapiro said parents should be given the authority to regulate.,1
"I have much more gun knowledge than all the crazy ass left liberal transgender hipsters due to video games. And no, I am very afraid of using guns outside. This goes to the same argument, Gun and Video games hold the same position a tool in the hands of a murderer. They are not to blame",0
"Meanwhile, Trump says ""we're gonna bomb the shit out of them""",0
what was even the purpose of this segment all 3 agreed. They had no one to defend video games.,0
my god THE REASON THAT KILLERS PLAY VIOLENT VIDEO GAMES IS BECAUSE THEY WANT TO KILL BEFOREHAND JESUS FUCK!,0
"guys I mean, duh, come on OF COURSE video games will make you more violent because kids TOOOTALY cant see a line between fake and real! I mean, I know that I for one, as a kid flew around on my magic dragon all the time because I had thought of it the day before, so obviously it happened in real life. Now if you excuse me, I just got shot 20 times in the chest, so I'm going to crouch behind a wall for about 3 seconds and all the bullets will vanish!",0
Right so I've played video games all my life and shot a gun for the first time and found it much more difficult then how its portrayed in a game. Yet somehow they think games train people to use guns effectively but nah some old cunts think they know better about a subject they knows absolutely nothing about,0
"Short answer: no.
Long answer: nooooooooooo.",0
"""Are video games linked to real world violence?""
no, if you said yes you are so sooooo stupid  you would rather blame games instead of physical problems that cause violence ( don't do fakenews, you will die way sooner than you think )
books were blamed for violence, movies and now games, games are blamed because they are the newest. go back to blaming books, nobody cares about them",0
Where can i find this CoD Montage?,0
"Here is an idea, Look at the recommended minimum age for the games, If you're a parent and you think your kid will become violent for playing a game, First off you're either the issue or you're kid is already a problem, Second just don't let your kid play those games, I have played hundreds of violent games over years of my life, And I don't have as much as a traffic violation ticket on my record.",1
Anders Brevik spent his time training in video games to prepare for his massacre? Are you fucking kidding me? Bet this guy hasn't even read Brevik's manifesto at all. He's been planning the attack long before the xbox even came out bro.,0
If every gamer were psychopaths than guess what it will be armageddon because millions and millions are playing so please piss off and let us play,0
But Girls Do Play these games -_-,0
Ya boys a fucking navy seal,0
"So we can ignore the fact that people sometimes play video games to escape from the real world, and that people who shoot schools are often treated poorly in their normal lives.  They don't start playing the games with the intent of training, they go in trying to have fun and escape for a while.",0
So u want take away our only escape from this feminists world.. wtf,0
"Yes because catching a puck as a goalie in hockey makes you a killer
Stupid",0
fucking 60 year old and 56 year old feminist talking about games fuck off lol,0
I think video can effect some people but not most people,0
We. Need. Chad.,1
It's almost like they can't see the dislikes,0
"Because flying from wall to wall with a bow and arrow shooting robots in the head while you drink mountain dew is just like real life  combat, good job at bringing the real facts to all the impressionable people who might be watching",0
Lmao this is great... wasnt trump the one who was in WWE?,0
So when u were fighting back in WW2 u played CoD first and GTA and u became violent. Statistics talk. Young crime has been decreased. Accept the truth and find the real solution to the school shootings. Grow up.,1
My man Ben,0
"Here's an insane idea, don't let your kids play Rated M games",1
How is playing video games immoral?,0
Bull shit,0
Does this guy even own a wii? He probably still uses a rotary phone.,0
Right.... Just cause I play videos games dont mean imma pull up to school when fortnite servers are down and double pump my Spanish class,0
"Video games don't make you violent. I asked my 8 year-old sister, who plays video games, if she will do what she sees on the screen in real life. Her answer was, ""No, we can't apply what we see in video games in real life."" And video games don't make you skilled at anything in real life. I mean, I should have been an excellent player if that logic was true. And for the shooting that happened in the school in Florida, the fact that that boy used to play video games has nothing with what he did. Anyone can take a gun and start shooting people randomly. If he actually showed some skills in his attack, then we can start blaming video games for that. Since that did not happen, some adults don't want us to think that because of their lack of responsibility, there kids turned out to be the wrong kind of people they wished them to be. What happens in video games is not real, and that is clear to everyone who plays. And do you know what is more frightening than video games? Showing people shooting each other during a war on the news. Why? It is because we are aware that video games are not real but wars are! I know I might be so wrong in some of what I said, so let me know if I am wrong, so I can delete the comment. Thanks for anyone who read this long comment.",0
Also never take games from kids it can make them depressed and so board the only fun thing is drugs sex and murder,0
So playing video games is bad... you can play games for a living and retire before your 30 how is that bad,0
Proven studies have shown girls play 3x  as much games as guys and the youth violence has dropped by 60% also assassination  that's in 18+ games if your don't want your kid playing them don't buy them it's not like they can buy them they are too young... also schools are using games to teach kids,0
So books which you can use your imagination... which could be 100x  as gory is not bad for you,0
Boys need to be outside playing doing physical stuff Get a Wii bitch,1
I enjoyed the open and civil debate. Thank you,0
I can't watch this shit....here I go killing again,0
"This is incredibly easy to disprove. Look at game sales. GTA 5 has sold over 90 million copies. 90 million. Why arent murder sprees higher? Why arent homocides much much much higher? And remember, thats just gta 5. Look, if you dont want your kids playing then thats fine. But lets not act like they are teaching people how to be criminals.",0
CALL OF DOOT,0
Bruh they showed fortnite,0
like how liberals talk about guns is like how you guys talk about video games. You never tried them. You don't know anything about them.,0
This is the stupidest fucking thing Ive ever heard and they used fortnite as an actual violent video game Im a fucking skeleton with a unicorn pic axe the fuck,0
"Holly shit something I partly agree with Ben on,video games not lead to violence, but that being said how can he then claim they're immoral",0
I'm not into politics but its funny how when the guy on the right brings up the fact that the popularity of games has gone up and the crime rate has gone down the 2 dumbasses look at him like he is stupid and say its not relevant. The guy on the right is dumb as shit and i would cum on the females face.,0
"This has nothing to do with gaming. What it is, in fact, is lazy parenting. Games are rated, parents should know better than to get these for their very young kids. If you think your child can handle it, why not sit down and talk with them about what is and isn't right or moral? Oh, because parents these days are lazy and would rather the government parent for them. It's sickening.",1
"I got spawn peaked by a tachanka
Time to grab my AR and shoot up the school",0
Ben ended this when he said statistics prove otherwise but i respect his approach toward his kids but nobody is gonna take my world away from me because its sth we have in common with most criminals  last time i checked most humans play video games most humans eat take a dump and sleep so we should focus on these issues as well,0
Idiotic if you think video games produce violence. Forgot there was never a murder before GTA was ever released.,0
that guy was having a really good COD game,0
"So, do you think the columbine school shooters were normal people berfore they came in contact with videogames? So stop talking about video game violence and focus more on the fact that in the US gun control is a joke. And even mentaly ill citizens can aquire a gun really easily",1
"Video Games train to kill, just like Clue trains people to get away with murder.",0
"i liked what Shapiro said... i dislike what Fox and Trump are doing (basically the same tactic on the Left) blaming the violence on an inanimate object instead of facing the problems with current legislation. Also if you want to talk about the promotion of violence to our youth, why not call out the rappers that young men in the inner cities idolize and strive to rise their ""street cred"" Personally i think rap is fine as long as you follow the same logic as video games, Entertainment is not reality so dont try and replicate it. PS. many gamers are right wing and have been since the media has tried to step in and make certain titles ""politically correct"", in other words, youre chopping down the wrong tree FOX",0
You know what else the military uses for training???? Guns. Maybe limit guns. Oh this is fox,1
IF YOU DONT WANT SHOOTINGS AND VIOLENCE JUST BAN THOSE FUCKING GUNS,1
"When even a brainlet like Shapiro questions the validity of your bullshit, you know you've fucked up hard.",0
Once again Ben is smarter than other people.,0
At 2:26 the argument was already won. With hard facts and heavy duty balls.,0
"Yes, these violent videos games are great training mechanisms for people who are ALREADY psychopaths. No, they DONT make people into psychopaths. Seeing gory events in video games is one thing, but I know ITS NOT REAL. It looks real, but it isn't. If I see so much as a bad cut in real life and I'm 2 miles away in disgust",0
